"A a sixteen year-old girl, presented to our Outpatient department with the complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back as well as restriction of body movements. She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region. To counter the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, she would keep her limbs in a specific position to allow her body weight to be supported. Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine."
"This is the case of a 56-year-old man that was complaining of a dump pain on the right back and a swelling right in this place for several weeks. The patient was in good state and very active. There was not any health problem in the past except a thoracic trauma at work one year ago. In that time the patient was diagnosed with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib without any other consequences.\nOn the X-ray was seen a shadow in the lower part of the right hemithorax. After that, it was decided to perform a CT-scan of the thorax that revealed a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax that measured 8 × 4 cm and had a heterogeneous density inside of it. The tumor had involved and destructed the 9th rib and was lying even in two adjacent intercostal spaces, but without involving the lung and muscular layers. On lung window of the CT-scan were seen micronodular infiltrations of both lungs with diameters up to 5 mm and only one nodule in lower lobe of the right lung with diameter almost 1 cm (). The mediastinum was without enlarged lymph nodes and no other lesion was seen in adjacent organs. The conclusion of the radiologist was that probably this was the case of a malignant tumor of the thoracic wall with secondary lesions in both lungs and a biopsy of the tumor was recommended.\nBecause there was not a correlation between the clinical picture of the patient and the conclusion of the radiology it was decided to perform frozen biopsy of the lesions of the right lung and an excision biopsy of the tumor of the thoracic wall. So, through a small posterior thoracotomy at 7th intercostal space were sampled five nodular lesions from the right lung and a sample from the tumor. None of these samples resulted positive (no malignant cells found) after frozen biopsy. In such conditions was considered as more realistic the option of performing an oncologic resection of the tumor of the thoracic wall. (We resected three ribs where the 8th and 10th ribs were macroscopically free of the tumor. The resection was extended 10 cm anteriorly from the tumor and posteriorly it was accompanied by disarticulation of the ribs and partial resection of transversal processes of 8th, 9th, and 10th vertebras.) After that, we have performed a plastic procedure with polypropylene mesh in double layers to correct the defect. The clinical course of the patient was very good and five days later he was discharged from the hospital in very good condition. The conclusion of biopsy for both the tumor of thoracic wall and the lung nodules was sclerosing xanthofibroma which is considered by most people to be a tumor with different clinical and radiological features. Lesions were characterized by a network of anastomosing bone trabeculae without osteoblast lining within a fibrous stroma ().\nReferring to the follow-up, the patient was in a great state of health and from the first month after the surgery he turned back at his work place. Two years after the surgery the thoracic CT-scan showed neither recurrences of the lesions of the thoracic wall nor new developments on the lungs."
"A 36-year old female patient visited our hospital with a chief complaint of pain and restricted range of motion (ROM) in the left hip joint persisting for two months. Physical examination of the patient revealed severe gait disturbance secondary to hip pain aggravated by hip joint flexion or rotation. The patient had no lifestyle habits or specific comorbidities thought to cause femoral head AVN. An anteroposterior view of the left hip revealed sclerosis and collapse of the femoral head and dysplasia of the hip (). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed an increased amount of joint fluid and bone marrow edema in the left hip, and femoral head necrosis was detected on the contralateral side; however, the patient did not complain of any pain (). The patient underwent THA after being diagnosed with idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, was discharged in good condition three weeks after the surgery without specific complications, and followed up via regular outpatient visits. The patient complained of pain and limited ROM in the contralateral hip joint and gait disturbance one year after the initial surgery. Her symptoms continued for two months and increased over the following three weeks. Repeat MRI revealed similar findings to those noted previously in the left hip (). A second THA was performed (one year after the first THA of the left hip); the patient was discharged in good condition after the surgery without specific complications and followed up via regular outpatient visits (). At the time of the second surgery, the patient was 7 kg heavier than she was at the time of the first procedure and developed a moderate moon face, signs that were initially overlooked as weight gain. Subsequently, the patient complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery. However, these signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital due to a progressive worsening of central obesity and muscle mass reduction of the limbs and hot flushes. She was diagnosed with hypertension due to high blood pressure and electrolyte inbalance and prescribed medication. She was suspected of having secondary hypertension, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were conducted. Although echocardiography yielded no specific findings, abdominal CT detected a 2.5 cm benign adrenal adenoma (). The patient was immediately referred to the Department of Endocrinology to be screened for Cushing's syndrome. During screening, a 24-hour urine free cortisol revealed an elevation to 394.3 µg/day (normal, >50 µg/day) and a plasma cortisol level of 29.0 µg/dL (normal, <5.0 µg/dL) was noted based on the results of a 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of 21.5 pg/mL (normal range, 6–76 pg/mL) and cortisol levels between 17.3 and 19.9 µg/day in a high-dose dexamethasone test confirmed Cushing's syndrome. A suspected cause was ectopic ACTH-producing tumors due to an adrenocortical adenoma. An in-depth history was then undertaken. The patient disregarded advice to undergo regular monitoring of a small abdominal mass found in a regular check-up done several years before her first visit to our hospital. At the time, she had menstrual irregularity, mild weight gain, depression and intermittent facial skin problems–clinical signs associated with Cushing's syndrome. We determined that asymptomatic AI developed into symptomatic Cushing's syndrome, and the patient underwent laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy after referral to our urology department (). Histopathological examination confirmed cortical adenoma. Six months after the procedure, Cushing's syndrome-related symptoms completely disappeared, including feelings of helplessness and central obesity. The patient is currently under outpatient observation without any specific symptoms.\nThe patient's informed consent and institutional review board's clearance were obtained for the purpose of publication of a case report. This article was approved by Gwangju Veterans Hospital at July 2, 2018 (project number, GVHIRB 18-0023)."
"A 49-year-old male presented with a complaint of pain in the left proximal forearm after a fall. The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would thus act as an intramedullary device.\nIn the operating room the patient was placed in a supine position and a posterior incision centered over the elbow was performed. A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins were removed from the humerus []. A wedge osteotomy of the arthrodesis site was then performed and the fusion taken down (). This was performed at the apex of the arthrodesis site with the humeral cut at 90 degrees to the long axis of the humerus and the ulnar cut at 45 degrees to the long axis of the ulna. The cuts were done in this manner to better accommodate the stems of the prosthesis. Resection of the humerus was greater than normal to allow for appropriate range of motion (ROM) of the elbow without undue tension on the neurovascular structures, which had been in this position for over 30 years. Resection of the radial head was performed as it was markedly arthritic. After preparation of the canals, a Stryker distal humeral replacement system was used to perform the total elbow arthroplasty (MRS (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI)). Intraoperatively, the patient had full flexion and extension of the elbow and full pronation and supination. His muscles were properly tensioned without undue strain on the neurovascular structures. The patient's ulnar nonunion was also addressed with bone graft taken from the resected radial head. He had an uncomplicated hospital course and was allowed full ROM on postoperative day #2. At his 4.5-month appointment, the patient was achieving 0–110° elbow active elbow flexion/extension, as well as nearly full forearm rotation. He was experiencing minimal pain and was happy with the function of his prosthesis. The patient was able to return to work with an elbow brace that he locked at work. Radiographs showed a healed ulna nonunion and a stable total elbow prosthesis without signs of loosening (). Multiple attempts to contact the patient for further follow-up have been unsuccessful."
"A 47-year-old male patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic because of recurrent attacks of pain in both knees over 1 year.\nIn September 2016, the patient presented with severe pain over the medial aspect of the left knee for a two-week duration which prevented him from ambulation. The pain increased with weight-bearing physical activity. The patient reported no history of trauma before the onset of the knee pain. Examination showed severe tenderness over the medial side of the knee with mild effusion and moderate limitation of range of motion. There was no erythema or increased warmth of the knee. MRI of the left knee showed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema/contusion involving the medial femoral condyle in mid and anterior parts predominantly along the articular surface. The patient was prescribed diclofenac sodium 50 mg twice daily and was advised to avoid prolonged weight-bearing activities. Over the next few weeks, the pain subsided and resolved. Three months later, the patient developed spontaneous new onset of pain involving the lateral aspect of the same knee. MRI showed bone marrow edema involving the lateral femoral condyle with complete resolution of the bone marrow edema of the medial femoral condyle. He was treated conservatively with NSAIDs and physiotherapy and advised to use cane to minimize weight bearing on the diseased knee. demonstrates MRI of the left knee in September 2016 and three months later.\nIn April 2017, the patient developed gradual pain over the medial side of the right knee with no obvious swelling. MRI of the right knee showed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema involving the medial tibial plateau medially and anteriorly. The patient was treated conservatively in a similar fashion to the previous episode. Four months later, the pain got more severe for which he underwent another MRI of the right knee which showed extensive marrow edema involving the medial femoral condyle with complete recovery of the medial tibial plateau bone marrow edema noted in the previous MRI (). The patient also recalled a similar pain happened in 2011 to the left knee but did not do MRI at that time.\nIn all previous presentations, the patient did not report any history of trauma, fall, twist, constitutional symptoms, or using corticosteroids. He also had no history of other joint involvement apart from knees and denied any history of low back pain. He did not have any features suggestive of spondyloarthropathy or connective tissue disease.\nPast history is significant for fracture of the greater tuberosity of the left humerus and undisplaced fracture of the left cuboid bone. Fractures happened after he fell off a ladder. Also, he is known to have mild asthma which is controlled with as-needed bronchodilator and hypertension maintained on amlodipine 5 mg daily. The patient had never been a smoker or an alcohol consumer.\nLab investigations revealed vitamin D 8 ng/mL (normal: >30 ng/mL), corrected calcium 2.16 mmol/L (normal: 2.10–2.60 mmol/L), parathyroid hormone 91 pg/ml (normal: 15–65 pg/ml), and alkaline phosphatase 49 U/L (normal: 40–150 U/L). Complete blood count, kidney and liver function, CRP, and ESR were within normal limit. Immunology profile including rheumatoid factor, ACPA, ANA, anticardiolipin, and B2-glycoprotein were all negative.\nDXA scan showed a T score of −1.0 at the lumbar spine and −1.6 at the left femoral neck suggestive of osteopenia. shows further details of the DXA scan.\nThe patient was treated conservatively with oral vitamin D2 50,000 IU/week supplement and NSAIDs. Gradually, the symptoms subsided over the next few weeks, and vitamin D level became normal after 12 weeks."
"A 24-year-old Yemeni female presented to the endocrinology clinic in April 2017 because of inability to walk and a long history of osteomalacia. She was unable to walk for the last 4 years with severe weakness and bone pain. She reported that for the last 2 years she was so weak that she could not turn over in bed and this was associated with pain all over her body. Her condition started as a baby as she did not walk till she was 2.5 years old. Then when she started school she stated she could walk but could never run, the family was poor and never sought medical help for her condition. She got married at a young age of 15 and became pregnant soon after that. During her pregnancy she had difficulty in walking and had pain in her legs, she needed assistance to rise from the sitting position and she was told she would need a cesarean section because she had a contracted pelvis, but she went into labor before she was able to have a cesarean section and she delivered vaginally and developed a fracture of the pubic rami during delivery.\nHer condition over the following years worsened and she was having more difficulty in walking and needed assistance in climbing stairs. She went to several orthopedic surgeons and she was diagnosed as osteomalacia and given calcium and vitamin D without any improvement, till she became totally bedridden. At one time she was also given calcitriol in small doses and for short periods of time 0.25 mg daily. She eventually stopped all treatments when she did not see any improvement in her condition. She was also seen by a neurologist and was found to have a normal nerve conduction study and was told there was no evidence of neurological disease.\nShe has no family history of a similar condition in her parents or siblings or other relatives.\nAt her initial presentation, physical examination of the patient showed that she was 144 cm tall and weighed 49 kg, she was much shorter than the rest of her family. She had normal teeth and hair development. Examination was within normal limits except that she had generalized weakness and tenderness in her extremities with bowing of the legs and genu valgus. All the blood work that the patient had from 2012 to 2019 can be seen in Table ."
"We report a 24-day-old female baby who presented with dyspnea and fever. Examination showed decreased air entry on the left side and a subsequent chest radiograph showed what looked like a consolidation of that lung and air-filled bowel loops inside the chest and a further ultrasound examination also identified intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney. A computed tomography (CT) of her thorax was performed, which confirmed left-sided diaphragmatic defect with large and small bowel and a normal looking, completely intrathoracic, ipsilateral left kidney and adrenal gland. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery with no antenatal diagnosis; she had normal Apgar score and did not require any resuscitation.\nThe procedure was performed in left lateral decubitus position. A 5 mm camera port was inserted by open technique in anterior axillary and two 3 mm working ports were inserted under vision on either side of camera port. The examination confirmed the CT findings (\n). The herniated large and small bowel was pushed and reduced into the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect which then revealed a completely intrathoracic kidney encased in Gerota's fascia (\n).\nThe kidney was then reduced into the abdominal cavity retroperitoneally by pushing it down through the diaphragmatic defect (\n). A primary repair using interrupted nonabsorbable sutures was achieved without tension (\n). Initially the gas pressure during the reduction in hernia contents was kept at 6 mm Hg but was then reduced to 4 mm Hg during closure of the defect. A chest drain was left in situ through the 5 mm port site at the end of procedure as there was violation of the pleura.\nThe baby had uneventful recovery and was extubated within 24 hours and chest drain was removed after 48 hours. Renal ultrasound scan showed a correctly positioned kidney with good perfusion and no signs of obstruction. She was discharged on day 5 postoperatively and is being followed up as an outpatient; her most recent renal ultrasound scan done 3 years postoperatively showed well and equally perfused kidneys with comparable renal volumes bilaterally without any evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter, or recurrence of the diaphragmatic hernia.\nDuring admission, the patient's mother gave a similar family history—her sister had had a similar condition at birth more than three decades ago. She had open repair of her diaphragmatic hernia at which an intrathoracic kidney was also found and reduced into the abdominal cavity. In the previous months, she had been diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in that kidney and she had just undergone a left radical nephrectomy for her condition. The child's parent asked whether she might have an increased risk of having similarly effected children and whether her daughter now had a higher risk of developing renal cell carcinoma in this kidney."
"A 16 years old female patient presented to us with inability to walk on both lower limbs since last 3 months. Earlier the patient was able to walk with a limp and would sway to either side while walking. Three months back patient experienced sudden onset pain in her right groin region while walking and the patient was not able to bear weight on her right lower limb. Then patient was walking with support, bearing weight on her left lower limb. In about a week, patient experienced similar pain in her left groin and was not able to bear weight on either lower limb since then and was left bed ridden. Clinical findings were consistent with coxa vara deformity of bilateral hips with a possibility of bilateral non-union of pathological fracture of femur neck. There was no evidence of any endocrine disturbance, or altered pigmentation or precocious puberty.\nOn imaging it was concluded that the patient suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd’s crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non – union of pathological fracture of neck femur (). Imaging of the other bones showed evidence of the fibrous dysplastic lesions in the shaft of left tibia ( and ). Magnetic resonance scanning of the bilateral hip region showed the features consistent with fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur shaft along with sub - capital fracture of femur neck without evidence of avascular necrosis of the femur head (). All the blood and serum biochemical investigations of the patient like the hemoglobin, total and differential white cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C – reactive protein, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase levels and all the hormonal studies were within normal limits. It was decided to do both correction of the deformity to realign the head, neck and shaft; and to achieve valgus at the neck - shaft region and a horizontal configuration neck fracture increasing the chances of union of pathological fracture of neck femur, in one stage, each side at a time.\nOn the right side, first oblique osteotomy was done from just distal to the greater trochanter up to the level of the neck to separate the greater trochanter and the second, lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomy was done at the subtrochanteric level to achieve alignment of the shaft with the proximal femur. With traction neck was aligned to the head and fixed with a 135° Dynamic Richard’s screw with a long side plate. The high riding greater trochanter was aligned with the neck and held with a tension band wire from above and medial to the abductors to hold the greater trochanter aligned.\n2 months later on the left side double lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomies were performed both at the subtrochanteric level to achieve the valgus at the neck – proximal femur shaft junction and to align the distal shaft with the proximal femur. After full correction the head and neck were aligned and the vertical geometry of pathological fracture neck femur was converted into a more horizontal one increasing the chances of union of the fracture. Fixation was done using a 135° Dynamic Richard’s screw with a long side plate to span both the osteotomy sites.\nPost – operatively we achieved a neck shaft angle of 135° on right side and 133° on the left side (). Patient was started on active and passive quadriceps strengthening exercises and after 6 weeks of immobilization toe touch weight bearing was started followed gradually by partial and complete weight bearing mobilization. Follow up imaging showed union at both the osteotomy sites bilaterally and also at the site of the pathological fracture of neck femur. Presently, at 18 months post – operatively (), patient is walking full weight bearing without support and there are no signs of recurrence of lesions of fibrous dysplasia or the deformity."
"We present a case of a seventy-three-year-old Saudi man who has started visiting the primary health care center in our institution twenty-five years ago. He has been concerned with having a cancer that would give him only few days to live. At the beginning, the patient was evaluated medically through detailed history and documentation of his symptoms and then a management plan was created accordingly to exclude cancer. Full history, physical examinations, and radiological and pathological investigations were ordered and the results were all negative for cancer. The physician explained the results of the investigations to the patient but he refused them and continued to insist that he had cancer regardless of the results. The patient was then referred to Psychiatry Department to be evaluated but he could not realize that his symptoms might be of a nonorganic cause, either psychological or mental.\nThe patient continued to visit the general hospital, emergency department, and the primary health care in the institution and was still occupied with the idea of cancer presence. Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again. The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named. Moreover, this persistent occupation with this belief was disabling and limiting him from having a normal life and thought that his days were counted in this life. Also, a persistent refusal of any medical advice or explanation for his symptoms and fears was neither related to schizophrenia nor related to mood disorders.\nA diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder was made despite the patient's strong refusal. The family and social history evaluation also revealed a very low socioeconomic status and similar conditions in the family. Interestingly, two of the patient's daughters had similar reported conditions which could raise the suspicion of the possible genetic predisposition that could be triggered by shared environmental factors between him and his daughters. Following this extensive detailed history and evaluation, the treating psychiatrist contacted the department of medical eligibility to make the patient's file eligible again as promised by them with an unlimited eligibility to all specialties and primary care center. For the past twenty-five years of continuous hospital visiting, he has had almost weekly and even daily visits to the primary care. The patient kept complaining of variable symptoms every week and specifically asking for certain lab tests and radiological studies. Also, he successfully convinced some physicians to order a biopsy for him.\nIt is reported that physicians in the primary health care center used different techniques of counseling and they applied the biopsychosocial model to overcome the patient's fears but often failed to reach an achievement as the patient continued to complain of different symptoms and became a burden on the physician's clinic time and the hospital resources. It is also reported that the patient was extremely difficult to handle and convince. In the absence of institution guidelines to deal with such cases, all physicians tended to yield to the patient's persistent complaints and accepted his demands and fulfilled his desires by requesting whatever investigations the patient asked for. Over the years, the patient's investigations have cost approximately $178200 due to the system negligence to such cases. The patient's most requested investigations were mainly invasive radiological studies specifically abdomen and pelvis CT (18 times) and wide range of other invasive and noninvasive studies like chest CT (11 times), brain CT (7 times), chest MRI (4 times), lumbar spine MRI (6 times), and other studies. It is important here to put emphasis on the potential harms of radiation from radiological studies that are frequently requested by the patient in the absence of clear guidelines to be followed by practitioners for that group of patients. In addition, the patient asked for a variety of lab tests including renal profile, parathyroid hormone, complete blood count, estimated glomerular filtration rate, coronary risk profile, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, thyroid stimulating hormone, prostate specific antigen, free T4 level, and other very wide range of lab tests. Moreover, the patient underwent several biopsies like renal biopsy, prostate biopsy, gastric biopsy, and other different types of biopsies.\nThe patient was abusing the system in which resources and time were wasted. The patient kept overstepping each barrier by the hospital's staff to minimize his burden on the hospital by manipulating staff and deceiving and misleading them by giving incorrect information. Also, he was targeting junior practitioners and disturbing them and even threatened to sue the administration if restricted from health care. Five years ago, an experienced board-certified family physician was shocked when he looked at the patient's file and decided to put an effort to solve this problem by taking some actions. First action considered, after getting the approval from the family medicine department, was to limit the patient's primary care visits to only one clinic and to refer him to the supervising physician himself. Then, building strong and effective patient rapport based on trust and honesty was initiated. After negotiations, the patient agreed to enroll in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for six sessions ninety minutes each. The patient was advised to have a scheduled sleeping time, ensure healthy eating habits with regular physical exercise, be involved in social activities, stay away from stressors like searching web for symptoms, and avoid TV health shows and health magazines during active cycles of disorder. After that, there was an agreement with the patient not to disturb the clinic and he would get to see the physician regularly for checkups every three months.\nAfter five years of implementing the new rules, the patient is still visiting the clinic for regular follow-up and sometimes he breaks the rules and comes regularly to the clinic especially in active cycles of the disorder. On following the patient's condition in the last five years, it is noticed that there is a dramatic decrease in the total financial cost due to the relative decreasing number of visits, less time spent on arguing with the patient, and the filtration of his requests. Moreover, there is a remarkable improvement in the patient's condition because of CBT and relative compliance to health advice. We think that this rare case of extremely persisting illness anxiety is worth reporting because the patient managed somehow to escape attention and made a huge financial burden on hospital resources in the absence of clear guidelines in such conditions. Also, this case provides useful insight for future guidelines development."
"A 23-year-old female patient was admitted to a plastic surgery clinic because of an esthetic problem caused by swelling on the scalp, which started 1 year previously and gradually worsened in the most recent 6 months. She underwent surgery under local anesthesia without guidance using an imaging method. Bleeding started at the beginning of the operation, and the procedure was terminated. Five months after the first operation, she suffered from increased swelling of the lesion. She was seen by another physician, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed []. The physician felt that it was a simple skin lesion that could be completely removed under local anesthesia. She underwent a second surgery and experienced severe hemorrhaging. Later, she was referred to our clinic. Her physical examination revealed a painful mass lesion measuring 5 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm in the left parietal region at the vertex level. She did not have any complaints except for her esthetic problem. The results of her neurological examination were normal. A vascular malformation at the scalp was considered, and a cerebral MR angiography was performed and revealed a vascular mass lesion, which was located in the left parietal region and supplied by the branches of the left external carotid artery for which venous drainage could not be clearly identified []. Therefore, we performed a conventional cerebral angiography and detected AVM in the left parietal region that was supplied via the branches of the left temporalis superficial artery, left meningeal media artery, and right temporalis superficialis artery []. The lesion did not have an intracranial component and had no direct drainage vein into the dural sinuses. The patient was surgically treated under general anesthesia in the supine position, and her head was elevated at a 30° angle. The skin flap was removed with a horseshoe incision considering the vascularization of the scalp. The vascular lesion in the soft tissue was dissected, and the malformation was revealed. Initially, the supplying arteries of the lesion were closed. Later, the lesion was completely removed along with its nidus. The bone underlying the lesion had become thin; hence, the periosteum was cauterized with bipolar coagulation. Hemorrhaging from the bone was controlled with monopolar coagulation and bone wax. The skin flap was closed without the need for an additional plastic intervention. The histopathological diagnosis was as AVM [Figure –]."
"A 32-year-old healthy female presented to a clinic (LS). The main complaint was severe pain in right temporomandibular joint (TMJ) region, right ear, mouth opening limitation, and asymmetrical of the face. The patient reported that she was born at full term by spontaneous vaginal delivery and no perinatal problems and no notable postnatal illness were reported. However, in the months following birth, the parents observed progressive enlargement of her right cheek and a differing eyelid width. According to the patient, the facial asymmetry had become more marked over the following years but had not increased in the past few years. No other family members were affected. Patient's mother reported a normal pregnancy. The enlargement extended from the midline to the preauricular region and inferiorly to the lower border of mandible []. The skin of the involved right side of the face was normal in appearance with no alteration in thickness. The extraoral examination revealed that the right side of the mandible was larger than the left side. The outer contour of the right ear was slightly larger and had a different shape compared to that of the left side []. The nose was normal with no deviation although the chin was deviated toward the side of her face. The lower lip on the right side was appeared thicker with drooping of the corner of the mouth on this side. The lips on the right side seemed very dry. The patient complained clicking in the left TMJ and disability in chewing and headache in the right side. Physical examination revealed normal symmetric body. The patient was mentally healthy. The mouth opening was 12 mm. On intraoral examination, asymmetry of the tongue was evident []. The right part of the tongue shows unilateral enlargement of fungiform papillae. The teeth size on the affected side appeared normal except the dimensions of maxillary right first molar, which was considerably greater than maxillary left first molar. The size of the lower right first molar was slightly greater than lower left first molar. The lower dental centerline was deviated to the right in relation to the midline and a downward canting of the occlusal plane was observed []. On occlusal examination, the central relation was unattainable. Furthermore, there was early contact in both central occlusion and right lateral movement. A discrepancy in range of mandibular motion was observed. The patient was referred for radiography. The radiographs confirmed the clinical findings. The panoramic radiograph [] showed that the right condyle, ramus, condylar neck, and the body of the mandible were enlarged. There was significant deposition of bone growth on the right mandible, and the bony trabeculation alteration was observed. The size of the right inferior dental canal was normal compared to the left mandibular canal and was displaced. Crowns and roots of the right mandibular molars were larger than the contralateral mandibular molars. The roots of the lower right first and second molars were remarkably divergent. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of the face and skull revealed that the zygomatic and frontal bones, right mastoid process, right half of the mandible and maxilla, maxillary sinus, and associated soft tissues were enlarged [Figure and ]. CBCT also demonstrated thickening the mucosal membrane of the right maxillary sinus [Figure and ]. There was no obstruction in the sinus meatus. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed no abnormalities [Figure and ]. 3D skull reconstruction CT image revealed hypertrophy of the right mandible, condyle, TMJ, zygomatic bone, petrous bone, and mastoid process []. The posteroanterior radiograph [] revealed enlargement of right half of the mandible, maxilla, and zygoma. The patient was referred to physician. Physician consultation reported systemic abnormality. Blood investigations were within normal limits. Depending on the clinical and radiographic abnormalities were thus consistent with the diagnosis of a hemifacial hypertrophy and fibrous hyperplasia. The patient was referred to oral surgeon. Surgical recontouring of right maxillary and mandibular bone was performed. After 6 months, condylectomy was performed for the right condyle; the size of the condyle was 5 cm × 3 cm []. The mouth opening was significantly increased to 4 cm."
"A 64-year-old Caucasian man from Austria was referred to the urological department because of episodes of intermittent gross hematuria. The patient had a colorectal carcinoma treated by rectum and ileum segment resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy four years before. After radiotherapy ureteric strictures developed on both sides and ureteric stents were placed. At the time of admission the urine specimen showed few white and red blood cells and the urine culture was sterile. During the change of the ureteric stents a retrograde pyelography and cystoscopy were performed, showing a mild gross hematuria coming out of the right ureteric orifice but no further pathological findings. After the stent change, first the hematuria cleared but one day later again an episode of gross hematuria with blood clots in the bladder occurred. A transurethral catheter was placed and a multiphase CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed. CT detected no source of bleeding. The gross hematuria cleared again and an ureteroscopy on both ureteric sides were performed with special emphasis on the right ureter. Once again nothing suspicious could be found. Thereafter gross hematuria appeared again with massive hemorrhage and an arteriography was performed (). But once again no underlying reason for the bleeding could be found. Two days later a gross hematuria with massive hemorrhage occurred. The patient became hemodynamically unstable and needed blood transfusion of 6 U. Therefore, the indication for nephrectomy of the suspicious right side was set and performed. During the operation the ureteric stent was removed and at the end of the operation the hematuria stopped. When the patient left the operation room again a massive hemorrhage was identified within the bladder catheter. Again an arteriography was performed. Finally, the region of the fistula was identified at the distal common iliac artery and a stent graft was deployed across the fistula (). A postoperative angiogram showed complete closure of the fistula (). After adequate blood transfusion and fluid replacement the patient made a rapid and unremarkable recovery. Twelve months later the patient is still well and the stent graft remains patent. However, the patient lost his right kidney."
"The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it (). The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared (). From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears (). Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition []. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A [], the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination (). She survived without recurrence of disease for two years after the operation."
"A 60-year-old Kashmiri female presented to our department after having sustained a fracture of femur in the supracondylar region. After initial management, the fracture was fixed with a dynamic condylar screw assembly. After an uneventful postoperative period, the patient was discharged with advice to undergo supervised physiotherapy. 3 months into the postoperative period, the patient reported to our emergency department with pain in the thigh. X rays revealed a fracture above the dynamic condylar screw at the plate bone interface. The patient was admitted and revision surgery with a longer barrel plate performed. The patient followed up for a period of 4 months and was bearing weight when she again had pain in the peri implant area. Radiographs revealed a fracture of the femur at the new peri implant region. The patient's femoral neck radiograph revealed an osteoporosis grading of 3 according to Singh's classification []. Keeping in view the potential morbidity associated with the repeat plating we planned a method that would be less invasive and less destructive to the local fracture environment. The proposed surgery was explained to the patient and her attendants. The ethical board permission was sought and obtained. The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on a fracture table. The screws in the plate were removed percutaneously under image intensifier control to ensure the patency of intramedullary canal leaving the plate insitu to avoid reexposure of the bone surface. The fracture was reduced and fixed with a reamed antegrade intramedullary nail. Anticipating the difficulties in distal locking with an insitu plate an external locking device comprising of a distal full ring and a proximal Italian arch connected by two threaded rods were used. No blood transfusion, bone grafting were used and the mean operating time was 40 minutes. The patient was ambulated on the first post operative day and discharged from the hospital on the same day after advising range of motion exercises of the knee. The patient was advised to compress the fracture at a rate of 1 mm per day in divided increments. The follow up was done at two week intervals. At a mean follow up of 8 weeks when the signs of healing were seen on the radiographs the external ilizarov fixator was removed. The fracture united at 14 weeks with a mean range of motion of the ipsilateral Knee being 0 to 120 degrees. There were no complications associated with the procedure."
"A 47 year old gentleman presented to his general practitioner with acute onset lower back pain. The pain had commenced during coitus and radiated down the right leg. The initial diagnosis was of acute disc prolapse and he was referred for an urgent neurosurgical opinion. The neurosurgeon concurred that the pain may well have been of neurological origin and arranged an MRI scan. This was reported as showing no evidence of spinal cord pathology. The patient was reassured with the results of the MRI findings and was advised the pain was probably musculoskeletal in origin and should settle. Over the subsequent 6 weeks, the pain persisted and indeed increased in severity. The patient noted claudication-type pain in his right leg after approximately 100 metres. As the pain had not resolved after 6 weeks he revisited his general practitioner. During the subsequent examination the pulses in his right leg were noted to be absent and he was referred for an urgent vascular surgical opinion.\nThe patient was seen the following day in the vascular clinic where a history of severe acute claudication-type pain was noted in the right leg. There was a past medical history of marked hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, for which he took relevant medications, but none of angina, myocardial infarct or valvular heart disease. On clinical examination the heart rate was 68 beats per minute regular. The blood pressure in the right arm 130/70 mmHg was lower than that of the left arm 160/80. Cardiac examination was normal. There was no clinical evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Examination of the limbs revealed that the right lower limb pulses were all absent whilst those of the left leg were present and of good volume. An urgent abdominal ultrasound scan was arranged which demonstrated dissection of the intra-abdominal aorta and a subsequent CT scan (Figures , , ) confirmed that the dissection was a Type A dissection extending from the aortic valve down to the aortic bifurcation. A dissection flap was identified in the ascending aorta and also in the postero-inferior aspect of the descending aorta. Both lumens were noted to have flow within them with the true lumen supplying the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery and right renal artery and the false lumen supplying the left renal artery and inferior mesenteric artery. Immediately below the inferior mesenteric artery the false lumen obliterated.\nAn immediate opinion was sought at the regional cardiothoracic unit and the patient was transferred urgently under their care. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which confirmed the CT findings demonstrating turbulent flow in the ascending aorta suggestive of an intimal tear in the region although the lesion itself was not seen. The arch was mildly dilated but with no visible flap. Flow in the descending aorta was turbulent in the initial 2–3 cm suggesting intimal disruption.\nHe underwent operative repair of the thoracic dissection on the next available theatre list. The aortic valve was resuspended and the ascending aorta were replaced using an elephant trunk graft with reimplantation of the brachiocephalic artery on 1 patch and the left common carotid and subclavian arteries on a second patch.\nAfter 48 hours in the intensive care unit the patient was transferred to the ward where he made an uneventful recovery. Cardiac and cerebral functions were not impaired by the procedure as evidenced by return to preoperative state and no requirements for chronotropic medications.\nA routine postoperative CT scan demonstrated that the repair was satisfactory. There was thrombosis within the false lumen of the descending aorta but persistence of flow within both lumens of the abdominal aorta."
"A 68 year old male patient was admitted 48 hours after he suffered a severe hip injury when falling from a bridge. The initial Rx-ray at admission displayed a femoral neck fracture with dislocation of the femoral head into the pelvis (). The patient also presented macroscopic and laboratory confirmed hematuria. A CT scan was not available at that time, but because of the hematuria we suspected an anterior dislocation of the femoral head. A Foley catheter was introduced into the urinary balder and antibiotics were administrated. Surgery was performed next day in lateral approach of the hip with anterior capsulotomy. The femoral head was not found into the hip but in the pelvis and could not be extracted but only touched by finger through a laceration between the anterior acetabular rim and the decollated labrum, creating a dislocation space similar to the anterior dislocation or the shoulder. However a 50 mm Austin Moore prosthesis was implanted and after the surgery the patient had the femoral head replaced and the fractured femoral head retained as o loose fragment into the pelvis (). The patient was prepared for the next surgery and two days later the urologist extracted the femoral head by a new abdominal approach Gibson with retroperitoneal dissection of the common iliac vessels. The head was placed on the iliopsoas muscle and under the iliac common vessels, and during the procedure no visible injury of the ureter, balder or iliac vessels was found. Soon after removing the abdominal wound drainage the patient experienced pain in the hip, lost mobility and swelling occurred at the hip wound. Several punctures of the hip extracted a large amount of clear liquid which was investigated and was found to have density and elements like urine. A drainage tube was reinserted into the hip wound and the patient underwent repeated urological evaluation by urography and endoscopic techniques. A fistula injury of the ipsilateral ureter was found and an internal drainage of the ureter was introduced and left in situ for three months. The Moore prosthesis was extracted, the hip was debrided and irrigated with saline solution and gentamicin. The hip wound healed and the patient had a Girdlestone hip for about 5 months. The hip was revised with a total cemented Muller prosthesis, which resulted in a normal evolution of the wound and rehabilitation."
"A 49 years old female presented with history of recurrent palpitations for last 10 years. During last year, she had 5 episodes of palpitations which required hospitalizations. The tachyardia was repeatedly terminated by intravenous adenosine and verapamil. She was nondiabetic and nonhypertensive. General physical and cardiovascular examination were normal. Her baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left bundle branch block with normal PR interval. The electrocardiogram of tachycardia revealed similar morphology, with the heart rate of 210 beats/min. (). Her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not show any evidence of structural heart disease. An electrophysiological study was planned with a presumptive diagnosis of AVNRT. Catheter manipulation to obtain His bundle electrogram led to complete heart block because of trauma to right bundle that required temporary right ventricular pacing. No tachycardia could be induced during complete heart block and there was no evidence of accessory pathway. Complete heart block persisted for 3 hours during which she required temporary ventricular pacing support. Patient was discharged after 48 hours with a plan to restudy on recurrence. Within 15 days, she had 3 episode of tachycardia all terminated with intravenous adenosine. After the recurrence of episodes, she was taken up for a restudy with a plan of avoiding His bundle / Right bundle injury and as a part of the same plan to avoid His recording coronary sinus catheter was put from the right internal jugular vein. Three 7 F sheaths were put into right femoral vein and one 6F sheath was put into right internal jugular vein. One catheter was put into high right atrium and another into right ventricular apex carefully avoiding trauma to His bundle. From the internal jugular vein, since the catheter did not follow a normal course, angiogram was done that showed absent right superior vena cava and whole of the jugular system draining into hugely dilated coronary sinus which was missed on transthoracic echocardiogram (). At that point of time, when we found this venous anomaly the risk of ablation was again discussed with the family and the patient, explaining them the risk of development of complete heart block and need of permanent pacemaker which would be difficult in this patient. Deflectable catheter was then used to clearly define the upper and lower lip of coronary sinus to guide the ablation (). A 7F 4 mm tip steerable ablation catheter was positioned in right and left anterior oblique views. Tachycardia was induced and diagnosis of AVNRT was confirmed by standard protocol. The ablation was performed starting from the inferior lip of coronary sinus and gradually moving anteriorly towards the upper limb of coronary sinus. Intracardiac bipolar electrogram did not show any slow pathway potential near the coronary sinus ostium and at the site of successful ablation (). Just at the upper limb of coronary sinus good junctional rhythm was noted (). A complete lesion at 25-30 watts, temperature of 50ºC for 60 seconds was given. No VA or AV block was observed. Post ablation testing revealed absence of dual physiology and noninducable AVNRT. The patient was discharged on next day and till last follow up after 6 months she was asymptomatic."
"An 82-year-old female with 60 kg body weight and 156 cm height who was otherwise healthy underwent a right total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis under epidural anesthesia at a hospital nearby. The insertion of the epidural catheter and operation were finished without any problems and the removal of the epidural catheter was attempted as usual two days after the operation. The epidural catheter broke during its removal. The physician felt resistance when he tried to pull out the catheter and then the catheter was broken 13 cm from the tip. X-rays and a computed tomography scan were subsequently taken (). Although the catheter fragment retaining within the patient was long, a wait-and-see approach was initially employed because there was no neurological deficit. The effusion from the drain hole stopped two days later. No neurological deficit or fever developed after the first evaluation of the images. However, the migration of the catheter was found by imaging studies four weeks after the occurrence of the catheter breakage (). After detailed discussions with the patient and her family it was decided that a surgical removal of the retained catheter should be performed. Then, the patient was referred to our hospital.\nThere was no neurological deficit at the time of admission. A laminectomy was performed at L2-3 seven weeks after the catheter had broken. The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia and then the spinal level that needed to be treated and the retained catheter were identified by using an image intensifier. We exposed the spinal process at L2-3 and the L2 spinal process was split by an air drill. The catheter was confirmed to be present between the L2 and L3 spinous processes and the edge of the catheter was found to be broken (). The catheter went entered the epidural space through the flavum.\nAfter removal of the bilateral flavum in an usual manner the catheter was found to be coiled up at the surface of the dura mater and was covered by a thin reactive film (). The catheter was heading to the nerve root. No evidence of dural puncture by the catheter was found. The removal of the catheter was first attempted by simple traction, however, was found to be impossible because of the adhesion (). The adhesion of the dura mater surface was carefully exfoliated and then the removal of the catheter was accomplished (). No cerebral spinal fluid leakage was found after removal of the catheter."
"A 78 year old Caucasian male presented to our casualty 6 weeks following admission elsewhere with a history of swelling of the right leg and a pulmonary embolus. He had undergone VQ scanning with a proven diagnosis of pulmonary embolus and was therefore anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin.\nOn admission he had swelling of the right knee and lower thigh with loss of sensation on the dorsolateral aspect of the right foot. Clinical examination revealed a large mass in the right popliteal fossa. The initial diagnosis was that of deep venous thrombosis and imaging was undertaken and the patient referred for a vascular opinion.\nOn vascular review, the patient had a pulsatile mass comparable with a popliteal artery aneurysm of 12 cms diameter on the right and 6 cms on the left. His foot was warm and well perfused and his INR was 2.6. He underwent a duplex scan of the lower limb arteries which revealed ectatic iliacs and an abdominal aorta of 3.4 cms in diameter. A further CT arteriogram (fig , ) confirmed that in fact the swelling on the right side was indeed a pseudo aneurysm following rupture with peripheral calcification.\nThe dilemma was therefore a patient with an established pulmonary embolus and a friable clot in the iliac veins, anticoagulation and the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Due to lack of expertise we elected to continue with full anticoagulation rather than place an inferior vena caval filter. Operative exploration was performed through a medial approach under full anticoagulation and the right popliteal artery was found to contain a large volume of blood pointing laterally. The popliteal aneurysm was excluded. Duplex examination of the upper and lower limb veins revealed that the veins were of small diameter therefore revascularization of the leg was established by an inlay 8 mm PTFE graft. Due to continuous oozing, the aneurysm sac was packed and the end of the pack brought out laterally. The pack was removed at 48 hours under sedation. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Six weeks later he underwent repair of the left popliteal aneurysm."
"On the 24th April 2006 a 9 month old girl was brought to the Emergency Department of a hospital which routinely refers patients to us. She had sustained a dog bite to her face 30 minutes previously. She was seen by the emergency physicians and was found to have received multiple lacerations to her face over the right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eye lid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek and over her left body of her mandible. She was fully examined and found to have no wounds elsewhere however due to the circumstances of patient and parental distress, intra-oral examination was not possible. The initial work up did not include radiographic investigations as it was felt by the emergency physicians that only a soft tissue injury was sustained. On the advice of the on-call maxillofacial team she had her facial wounds cleaned with aqueous iodine solution and she was started on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol. An examination by the ophthalmologist revealed no ocular injury.\nShe was transferred to our unit the following day, fasted in preparation for an examination under general anaesthesia and primary closure of her facial lacerations. During the procedure it was found that she had sustained an open fracture of her left mandible consistent with a dog bite. (fig ). This was treated via a trans-oral approach with a five hole 1.2 mm titanium plate and four 3 mm screws. (fig ). She had her facial laceration copiously irrigated with normal saline and chlorhexidine and primarily closed in with a fine nylon suture. She was discharged home the next day. Seven days later she attended for removal of sutures under a general anaesthetic and examination of her jaw. The facial wounds were healing well and there was no movement at the fracture site. Ten weeks after the first operation she was admitted for removal of her mandibular plate under general anaesthetic. There was good bony union and the plate was removed with no complications (fig ). She will continue to be reviewed in clinic to monitor dentoalveolar development and mandibular growth."
