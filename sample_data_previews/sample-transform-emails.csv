"Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the  time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and  Flagstaff.
He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the  permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will  do an expidited review.
Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to  initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an  expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.
Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project.

"Hi gang!
Hope all is well with you all.
Just thought I'd give you all an update on our new home, that is if all the inspections go smoothly.
It's in Browns Pt., 4602 41st St. to be exact, it's described as a super clean rambler, new carpet, vaulted ceilings with fireplace in living room, kitchen has nook,island, family rm, big fenced backyard which seems well landscaped to my standards anyway.
It has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2 car garage w/ opener!
We'll be closer to family, friends,Steve's work & hopefully have a better sense of community for Queen Isabel.
We're excited to say that we're just outside Tuscany, which is where a beautiful community lies with $300k & up homes.
Can't wait to have you all over to unpack, clean, paint, babysit & mow the lawn, so mark your calendars for Nov. 30th!
This is also Steve's 34th birthday, hmmmm I think I'll buy him a house, don't ruin the surprise.
Take care, Jennifer

"Someone was asking me the other day if I had any friends at Enron....you came to mind!
Are you weathering the storm?
Unbelievable is the word that comes to my mind.
We use Andersen also and I know they are quite ""tight lipped"" about the situation!
I sincerely hope everything works out for you and the other Enron employees that have done nothing more than ""bust your rears"" for the good of the ""Big E"".

I also left a message for Jeff because I was told that  he worked on the transaction.
The name ""Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona"" (""Stadacona"") does not appear on  the corporate database so I cannot verify that it is an Enron-owned entity.

As a result, we would like to migrate ONLY the curves that they will be using for UBS trading so as not to take up any unneccessary space.
