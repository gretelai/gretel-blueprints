If youâ€™re new to Gretel, our synthetic data blueprint is a great place to start. This gentle introduction to synthetic data generation automatically selects our popular [ACTGAN model](https://gretel.ai/blog/scale-synthetic-data-to-millions-of-rows-with-actgan) and provides a sample healthcare dataset. Just answer a few questions, review the model configuration and hit **Run**. 

Prefer coding? Check out the [Gretel 101 notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gretelai/gretel-blueprints/blob/main/sdk_blueprints/Gretel_101_Blueprint.ipynb) example. Synthesize data in just 4 lines of code! 

If you're interested in exploring further, try out our [Advanced Tabular Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gretelai/gretel-blueprints/blob/main/sdk_blueprints/Gretel_Advanced_Tabular_Blueprint.ipynb). The [Gretel SDK](https://gretel.ai/blog/we-just-streamlined-gretels-python-sdk) enables advanced features such as conditional generation, custom parameters, and easy integration with data pipelines.
