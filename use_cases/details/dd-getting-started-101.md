Welcome to this comprehensive introduction to Gretel's Data Designer! This guide will walk you through the essential concepts and techniques you need to generate high-quality synthetic data for your projects.

Data Designer is a powerful tool in Gretel's ecosystem that allows you to programmatically define and generate synthetic data with precise control over structure, relationships, and statistical properties. Whether you need test data for development, synthetic data for privacy protection, or training data for AI models, Data Designer provides a flexible and powerful solution.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Create synthetic datasets with various column types
- Define relationships between columns using expressions
- Generate realistic person data with demographic information
- Use statistical distributions to create numeric data
- Leverage LLMs to generate text data grounded in the context you want
- Add constraints to ensure data validity
- Preview and generate your final dataset
- Work with seed data to amplify existing datasets
- Create structured outputs using Pydantic or JSON Schema
