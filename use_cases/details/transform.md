![Transform unstructured data into AI-ready formats](https://blueprints.gretel.cloud/use_cases/images/boost-minority-class-hero.png "Transform unstructured data into AI-ready formats")

Transform your data into privacy-safe formats without sacrificing utility. This blueprint provides ready-to-use configurations for detecting and redacting personally identifiable information (PII) in both structured and unstructured data. Get started immediately with our sample dataset, or upload your own files to see how quickly you can create privacy-enhanced versions of your data.

The configuration is highly flexible, allowing you to control exactly how sensitive information is handled - whether by redacting, hashing, or replacing with realistic synthetic values. You can even define custom entity types beyond standard PII categories, making this solution adaptable for specialized domains like healthcare, finance, or legal applications while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.
