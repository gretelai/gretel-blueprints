If youâ€™re new to Gretel, our Navigator Fine-Tuning blueprint is a great place to start. This blueprint automatically selects our comprehensive multi-modal model, a great one-stop shop for most synthetic data generation needs. Just answer a few questions, review the model configuration and hit **Run**. 

Navigator Fine-Tuning supports mutliple tabular modalities of data within a single model, such as numeric, categorical, and free text data.
