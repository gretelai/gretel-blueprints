Different models for synthetic data generation may produce varying results in training and generation time and/or synthetic data quality, depending on the training data type and shape. 

### Notebook Details

This notebook walks you through how to use [Gretel Benchmark](https://docs.gretel.ai/reference/benchmark) to compare and analyze multiple synthetic data algorithms, including but not limited to Gretel models, on a standardized set of tests. You can use your own datasets, choose from popular publicly available datasets for various industry use cases, call Gretel models or create a custom model class in Python, and then compare all models on all datasets with a single comparison function. 

[Read our blog](https://gretel.ai/blog/introducing-gretel-benchmark) to see an example, learn more using [our reference docs](https://docs.gretel.ai/reference/benchmark), or try out the quickstart notebook below to start evaluating.
