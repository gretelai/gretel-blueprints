Gretel image synthetics enables enterprises to harness image-focused generative AI, and compose their domain data with the knowledge built into foundation models. We designed our image synthetics system specifically for generating domain-specific images at scale, with an emphasis on the high-quality needed for training downstream ML models.

See some examples of the types of use cases you can address on our blog posts: [auto insurance](https://gretel.ai/blog/bringing-ai-generated-images-to-enterprise-use-cases) and [agritech](https://gretel.ai/blog/synthetic-image-models-for-smart-agriculture). 

Try out Gretel image synthetics for **free** while it's in public review. Use it to build a custom use case such as windshields, receipts, x-rays, or even your own superhero avatar. Once it's generally available, the new model will bring to images the same high-quality, scalable and private synthetic data generation you're used to for tabular, natural language and time series datasets. 

We'd love to hear your feedback. Join the [Synthetic Data Community](https://grtl.ai/discord) on Discord to see what others are creating, and share your favorite creations.
