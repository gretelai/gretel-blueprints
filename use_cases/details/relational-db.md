Gretel Relational takes you beyond synthesizing and transforming one table at a time, and enables generating entire databases, all while maintaining referential integrity. This early preview will give you a taste of what's coming in the Gretel Console and CLI/SDK. [We'd love to hear your feedback!](https://dqq4jigtkl1.typeform.com/to/Gibb8awJ)

### Notebook Details

In the notebooks below, we've created two practical examples using a telecommunications database and Gretel Relational. See the database schema below.

In the first example, we'll synthesize all 5 tables in the database, while in the second, we will transform the data to remove PII (Personally Identifiable Information). You can also transform and then synthesize a dataset; stay tuned for a blog post and notebook on that soon.

We'll demonstrate how easy it is to connect to a database, run Gretel Relational, view quality metrics, and output the data back into a database. We will also test that referential integrity exists both before and after data is synthesized/transformed.
