This blueprint helps you add HIPAA controls to your datasets in minutes. First, we'll transform your original data by identifying and protecting sensitive fields. Then, we'll help you synthesize a new dataset that maintains the analytical value of your data while implementing appropriate safeguards.

The process is simple: upload your healthcare data, modify a few parameters or use our defaults, and let us handle all the technical details. The result is a dataset that's perfect for teams who need to share data for research, analysis, or model training while prioritizing patient privacy. We also provide a ready-to-use sample healthcare dataset so you can test the HIPAA controls immediately.
