Gretel Navigator is the first agent-based, compound AI system purpose-built to design high-quality tabular datasets. With Navigator, you can easily create new datasets or augment your existing datasets based on a text prompt. 

Navigator is Gretel's first compound AI system that leverages multiple LLMs and agentic tools to deliver high quality, highly realistic tabular data at enterprise scale, all from just a prompt or sample data. 

Popular use cases include: generating data for RAG (retrieval augmented generation) evaluation, adding summary or predictive columns to existing datasets, and generating demo data.  

Try Navigator in the console, or check out one of our advanced notebook examples.
