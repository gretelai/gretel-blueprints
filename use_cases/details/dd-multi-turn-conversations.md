Gretel Navigator Data Designer is a powerful compound AI system that helps you create high-quality synthetic datasets from scratch. Unlike typical data generation tools, Data Designer combines multiple specialized AI models--including small and large language models, probabilistic graphical models, and numerical generators--to produce data that's truly tailored to your specific needs. Whether you're facing data scarcity, privacy constraints, or simply need more diverse examples, Data Designer delivers synthetic data that's realistic, domain-specific, and ready to use.

The Multi-Turn Conversation Generator blueprint showcases one of Data Designer's popular use cases: creating realistic dialogue datasets for training conversational AI. With this notebook, you'll learn how to generate diverse multi-turn conversations with varying complexity levels, topics, and emotional states. Perfect for teams building AI agents or virtual assistants, this blueprint demonstrates how you can control conversation flow, ensure contextual relevance across turns, and even include toxicity assessmentsâ€”all while maintaining natural language patterns that reflect real-world interactions.
