Unlock the potential of your text data while ensuring privacy by applying differentially private fine-tuning using Text Fine-Tuning. This method allows you to create a version of your free text data that maintains the integrity of sensitive information while still providing high-quality outputs.

We recommend having a dataset of at least 10,000 samples to ensure reasonable quality. Note that differential privacy requires more epochs, which leads to longer training times compared to running without differential privacy.
