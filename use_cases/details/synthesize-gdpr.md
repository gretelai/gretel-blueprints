This blueprint helps you achieve GDPR compliance with your European customer data in minutes. First, we'll transform your original dataset by identifying and protecting personal information like names, addresses, and identifiers. Then, we'll synthesize a new dataset that maintains the analytical value while implementing appropriate privacy safeguards.

The process is straightforward: upload your customer data, adjust parameters as needed or use our defaults, and let us handle the technical implementation. We've included a sample e-commerce dataset containing customer emails, addresses, and purchase information so you can immediately test the workflow without uploading your own data. The result is a GDPR-compliant dataset that's perfect for teams who need to share data across borders, with vendors, or for analytics while respecting privacy regulations.

After running the workflow, you'll receive a detailed quality and privacy report that helps you evaluate how well the synthetic data preserves patterns from the original while protecting personal information. The transformation blueprint addresses key GDPR concerns including pseudonymization of personal data, handling of special categories, and data minimization principles.
