How do you quickly remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from multiple csv files and automatically generate a fully anonymized synthetic dataset that's resistant to privacy attacks?  

### Notebook Details
This workflow will walk you through detecting and removing PII automatically, generating a new synthetic dataset, and reviewing detailed output reports proving the quality and safety of the generated data. We provide example datasets, such as Google Meet logs, e-commerce bike sales records, and electronic health records, but also make it easy to use your own.
