How do you quickly remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from multiple csv files and automatically generate a fully anonymized synthetic dataset that's resistant to privacy attacks, and meets global privacy standards?  

### Notebook Details
This notebook uses our [gdpr-helpers](https://github.com/gretelai/gdpr-helpers) and the Gretel Transform and Synthetics AI models to demonstrate how you can make your data GDPR and CCPA compliant. The workflow walks you through detecting and removing PII automatically, generating a new synthetic dataset, and reviewing detailed output reports proving the quality and safety of the generated data. We provide example datasets, such as Google Meet logs, e-commerce bike sales records, and electronic health records, but also make it easy to use your own.
