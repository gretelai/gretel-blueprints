Streamline your natural language processing projects with our Text Fine-Tuning blueprint. It supports the creation of labeled examples for various language tasks. From sentiment analysis to text summarization, Gretel Text Fine-Tuning makes it simple to prompt or fine-tune LLMs to enhance the quality of your datasets with precision and efficiency.

For Gretel Text Fine-Tuning, training and prompt data needs to be a single column CSV file containing natural language text. If working with a multi-column dataset, specify the text input column in the config.
