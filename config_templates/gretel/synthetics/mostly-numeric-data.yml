# For training on floating point data, PCA data, etc.
#
# Before training, consider crounding all floating points
# to the minimal precision necessary for your use case. This
# will help prevent the model from trying to memorize
# inconsequential data and learn separations in record better.
#
# Set vocab_size to 0 to help the model learn the numerical structures better
#
# Increasing rnn_units allows the network to learn more complex patterns, but
# at the expense of increased training and generation time.
