# Gretel Configuration for Amplification model creation
#
# Once this model is created, you may run the model to generate high
# volumes of synthetic data
#
# NOTE: Set either `num_records` or `target_size_mb` to a non-null integer. 
# If they are both null, the model will generate the same number of records as the training data. 
# If they are both non-null values, the config will be invalid.
