# deprecated: This configuration will be deprecated soon. Please use the
# "synthetics/tabular-lstm" configuration with dp: True to use experimental
# differential privacy with Gretel LSTM

# This is a configuration for enabling differential privacy during
# model training via DP-SGD.
#
# Differential privacy helps prevent unintended memorization of secrets in 
# the training data, by limiting the amount that any training example, or 
# small set of training examples can affect the model.
#
# Even though the analytical epsilon upper bound does not offer strong
# privacy guarantees, the benefits of differentially private training
# can be clearly observed by examining the trained model.
