# Gretel Synthetics Configuration Templates

The templates in this directory contain configurations to train synthetic models on data with a variety of characteristics and to enforce various levels of privacy protections.

Templates can be downloaded and modified for use with Gretel synthetics, or imported directly from the Gretel CLI via:

`gretel models create --config synthetics/[template_name] ...`


 | template_name      | description |
 | ----------- |  ----------- |
 |`default`| Use the `gretel-synthetics` LSTM model. This model works for a variety of synthetic data tasks including time-series, tabular, and text data. Generally useful for a few thousand records and upward. Dataset generally has a mix of categorical, continuous, and numerical values.  |
 |`complex-or-free-text` | Best for highly complex datasets, or those containing plain text such as tweets and conversations.  |
 |`differential-privacy` | Differential privacy helps prevent unintended memorization of secrets in the training data, by limiting the amount that any training example, or small set of training examples, can affect the model. Works best on large datasets with 50,000 or more records. |
 |`high-dimensionality`| Use for datasets with more than 20 columns and/or 50,000 rows. Works well for largely numeric data. Avoid if dataset contains free text fields.  |
 |`high-accuracy`| Useful for optimizing data for downstream ML tasks, at possible cost of higher compute. |
 |`low-record-count`| For datasets that have fewer than 1000 rows and/or 4 columns, and a mix of categorical, numerical, and continuous values.  |
 |`time-series`| Specialized model for time-series datasets. Modify this config with values that fit your dataset.  |
 |`natural-language`| Useful for single-column natural language datasets such as reviews, tweets, and conversations. Dataset must be single-column. |
