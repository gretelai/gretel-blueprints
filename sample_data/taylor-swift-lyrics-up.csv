"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?"
"Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you knownothing
Sequinsmile, black lipstick
Sensualpolitics
When you are young, they assumeyou know nothing


But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
You might also like
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan"
"I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's notfunnyat all
And ittook you five whole minutes
To packus up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall


I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Ooh, ooh, ooh


I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury


I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign 
All this time
I never learned to read your mind 
I couldn't turn things around 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign 
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

So I'm leavin' out the side door

"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my lover


Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my"
"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought Isawyou at thebus stop, I didn't though
I hitthe ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matine
You know the greatest films of all time were never made


I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one



I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now


I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone


But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun

In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time

"Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are yousure?""
""Neverhave I everbefore""


But I can see us lostin the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you


But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine


Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no


But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

"I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you 


But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do

Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast 
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

"Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause ofme
Betty,one time Iwas riding on my skateboard
When Ipassed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you


But if I just showed up at your party

Would you tell me to go fuck myself

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long


Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again


The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party


Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again"
"You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse


Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left yououttherestanding
Crestfallen on thelanding
Champagne problems
Your mom'sring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating


Dom Prignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny

If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

All the hell you gave me?
'Cause Ilovedyou,I swear Iloved you
'Til mydying day


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you 
And when you can't sleep at night 


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years"
"You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrn
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""


And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh 
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down


You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? 
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night


You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay


So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

You need to calm down 
You're being too loud

And you're the kind of guy the ladies want

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go


But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

You ran after me and called my name

"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

"Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?


Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it 
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it 


Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you


Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying 
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying 


So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

"Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I usedtothink I wouldmeet somebody there
Teal was the colorof your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
Youusedtowork at tomake a littlemoney


Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer


Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me

All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

Running scared, I was there

So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all"
"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coasttookher mind offSt. Louis
Bill was the heir tothe Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""Howdidamiddle-class divorce doit?""
The wedding wascharming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dal


And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been

"Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing overthecreek
I was tooscared to jump in
But I, Iwas high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on


Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, wont tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever"

I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn'tknowif you'd careif I came back
I have alot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


At least I'm trying


And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound

Bridges burn, I never learn

"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you



And I should just tell you to leave
'Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

Takes me home

But I can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""

Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friendsyou'reout for arun
Youll be flushed when you return
Takethe road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you dont even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times


And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind

Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

And you know you hurt him too


Honey, when I'm above the trees

Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it

Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I


Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it

Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated

I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh


I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end uponthefloor, anyway?"" yousay
""Your roommate's cheap-assscrew-top ros, that's how""
I see you every day now


And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew btween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up


And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was 
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was 
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon


And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy 
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

"Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire


And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind th tape, but all it does is pause
On th very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed


And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore


Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Spinning in my highest heels, love

Shining just for you


And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Taking mine, but it's been promised to another

Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you


I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed

He wants what's only yours

But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much 

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine


You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face 
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous


You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you

I've ghosted stand there in the room

I end up in crisis

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming


It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

I searched ""aurora borealis green""
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery

And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
Im spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about


All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Flashback when you met me, your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes, my rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Don't want no other shade of blue but you

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark

I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared


You're on your own, kid
You always have been


I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid


You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this"

Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
""Doc, I think she's crashing out""

Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?


Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years


I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you


I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question


Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the grey

Would've, could've, should've

I would've stayed on my knees

At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering


If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us


Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've

So I guess all the rumors are true

You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English


You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon

Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rentaplace on CorneliaStreet""
I say casually in the car
Wewere a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone


But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend

While I was gone, I would've asked you

There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parkd my car right between the Methodist
And th school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me


We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house

We could just ride around

And it always leads to you and my hometown


Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving

Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

All of you, all of me

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain


He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

Take me to the Lakeswhere all the poets went to die
I don't belong and,mybeloved,neither do you
ThoseWindermere peaks looklike a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse


I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry"
"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life 


No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared 


No cameras catch my muffled cries

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the storys over, why am I still writing pages?


Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough

'Cause I cant pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts


My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room

"Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?


And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down


The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?


'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Lost again with no surprises

And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived intheshade you werethrowing
'Til all of my sunshine wasgone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind


But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show


But you showed who you are, then one magical night


I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did

"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time


And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind


You see, all the wisst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game


If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails


What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
You might also like
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care


So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine"
"I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyones up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh

Outside, they're push and shovin

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that Im just too soft for all of it
Ooh

"Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight


Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put m in the basement
Whn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

Nice


Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl 
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world, have you heard? 
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you 
But I miss sparklin' 


Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

"I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something youdidntdo
I pinned yourhands behind your back, oh

Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til theres no us

I dont wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you 
I need to say, hey, its all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow


It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh


I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like Im not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it

Wed still worship this love

I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and were begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you

"Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya


Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea 
Dorothea 


Ooh, you'r a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything


Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well


Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show


But it's never too late to come back to my side

Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out

You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?


It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile


You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that


Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love

"See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone


'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes


Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

"It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year


So, why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey 
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things


It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence


But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately 
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling

"I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I


Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing


I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

"Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break


And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing

Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

Right down the rabbit hole

Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff

Once I've lost my novelty?

How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?


How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?


And someone else lights up the room 
People love an ingnue

You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me


What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive


And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around"
"The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...


Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...


Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to


And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?


This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because

"The drought was the very worst 
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth 
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



There was nothing left to do 
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof 
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



I think I am finally clean

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean

Still spells out pain

"Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me


Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

Right where you left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever


Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me


At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on


Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware

Mind my business

I can't bear witness
And it's been so long

"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered 
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good


Looking at it now
Last December 
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together 
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

"My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the ltter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If w survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War


Uh-huh, uh-huh


It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair

My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, we're burned for better
I vowed I would always be yours

Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War"
"I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic


I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man


I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning


But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run


Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand

If you were a better man

"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room

"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

Please don't have somebody waiting on you

Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?

Bad omen

And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me


You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills


But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

"I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world


Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""

"Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart 

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you

Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart


So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

"Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do


But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a caf, I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

"When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go


Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing


Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

"Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known


Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known


You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town

"We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom


'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace 
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true



'Cause baby, I could build a castle

Met someone at a club and he kissed her

Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003, unbearable

No, I didn't, but thanks, though


I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else


Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sip quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

"Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone


Been losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time


This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh

"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same


This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

"One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up""
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love
You are in love


Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you

"Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me


I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then


And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me




I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you

Taking flight, making me feel right

'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on


Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us

But it's been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout

Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

"I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when  music's gone
Gone


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away


I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time


Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof

In the dead of night, your eyes so green 
And I know for you, it's always me 
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I"

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

 Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
 Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was 


All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was

Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
You might also like
Oh, oh


And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts


I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about


Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh-oh


And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""


You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""


Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter 
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine 


Yes, yes, do you believe it? 
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now "
"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home


This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

"Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you

The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me"
"I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied


But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified


'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' her, hopin' it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replayin' your laughter, disaster


'Cause now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity



She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

"It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

"One, two, three, four


Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
""I'll wait for you""
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run


So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you


And run, like you'd run from the law

Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run

"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile

And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright

She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane?""

And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say


I want you for worse or for better

Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



But loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

You were outnumbered this time


But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget


They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun


Only one thing can save us

Only the young

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

But all you are is mean


All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


Now, its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that youre lucky, but youre so confused
'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if youll make it out alive


And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
You might also like
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right


Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one"
"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing 
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?


You should've been here
And I would've been so happy


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better


And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye 


You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better


And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me


This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list

"Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back


A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful


What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair"
"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e


And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were troubl when you walked in
So shame on m now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble


No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e

"I bet this time of night, youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont, I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out, theres no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont, I almost do, I almost do

"The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards

But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine


But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane

"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind

Your very first day"
"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back


Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then


Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?


It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now

So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time

There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car

In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless


So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance

And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway

I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be


I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?

Don't know why I do

"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say


Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine

They can't take what's ours"

Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead


Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again

I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted


Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time"
"Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy


But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah


Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this


But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?


So I'll walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say we're still friends

So if I see you again


Don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you  say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't  know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

"You said it in a simple way
4 a.m. the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


Oh-oh, oh-oh

"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again


I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

And when I got home, 'fore I said amen

"I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

"We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy


Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy

We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me

We were happy"
"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry


'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone


But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe


When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

"It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby
Bye bye, baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom

"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""


Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?


Don't say yes, run away now

But I'm only lookin' at you

But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha


So, don't say yes, run away now

"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to


It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend

"I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you





I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town lik an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry  at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious 
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Cursed the space that I needed

You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl


I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away


Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by

Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do

"I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah


Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same


'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong


You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me


You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness

"Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now


If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door


And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now""

"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that


I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned


So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that


I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have


And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it

"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you



Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through"
"All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around


You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before


But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 
You're not sorry 


You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade


So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

"Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you


Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway


But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh

"She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my


A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee


Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
You might also like
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine"
"In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread


So, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah


I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""

What I mean is


I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all"
"And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So, we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight aint fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away


Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today


Ahh-ahh-ahh

"I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you comin'
And I'll never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never  
Saw you comin' 
 
And I'll never  
Be the same 




This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

"There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, farless


So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this on-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh


Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless

And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing

And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side


And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you


Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do


And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me


I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true

Well, you drive me crazy half the time

Let you know that what I feel is true

Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you

"I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh


Baby, you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh-oh


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes"
"I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are


I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh


I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why


Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?


I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons

He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, ""How are you?
I say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

I'll be right here on the ground

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

"Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, ""Does he know?""
Will you ever know?


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, ""Hey, by the way""


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful


If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?

But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the on who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You blong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

"I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go


I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late, so you see


You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

"I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together


Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall


Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and  jump then fall into me

And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But ther was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knw


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today

'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
W block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for th first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance

Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room

"I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wdnesday in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you nver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do


But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid

What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities

I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

And asking me if I wanna try again with you

But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore


Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain


I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start


Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear


I'll leave my window open

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the thingsIwantedto
Of all thegirls tossing rocksat your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you 
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same


'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now

Everything has changed
All I know is you hld the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies

Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread


Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah


I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles

Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
"The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes

For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh


Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talkaboutit
'CauseI read youshould never leavea fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

"I remember when we broke up
The first time, saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change""
""Trust me,"" remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, evr, ever getting back togther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm


The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again

I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistak, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have th upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

Should've read the writing on the wall

I still can't believe that you would walk away

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

"I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing whn we walked in
The night w snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lft me waiting in the cold
And you've got your shar of secrets

Keep your ey-eyes open


The tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""

Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raidd, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when th fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this


Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There aint nothing more right, babe

I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning lonelinss
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
Whn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town

Talk to the man who put you here

You come around and the armor falls

Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

We learn to live with th pain
Mosaic broken hearts

As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie


He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine


I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes

My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

Is, ""My God, hes beautiful""

Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you

I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Now all we know, is dont let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same


This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
You might also like
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same


This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight"
"I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss


All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone


All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better


You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way


All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble"
"So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session.Iwas writing withtwo writers I hadn't ever workedwith before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called ""I Forgot That You Existed"", and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started


I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice


I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
I forgot that you existed
How I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?


I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice"
"But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
But girls could say he's just a bit too tall

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see

You don't have to do to win big

Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

In the least or masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing

Some say the grass could be greener

"I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!


Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!


Oh, you are everything I'll never need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is


Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?"
"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
You might also like
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
"I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh


'Cause they said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'


Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
They said the end is comin' 
Everyone's up to somethin'

"I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love
He swears, as herunshisfingers through hishair
I'm laughing 'causeI hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the Seventeenth
His sister's bautiful
He has his father's eys
And if you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie


He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine


I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the Seventeenth
His sister's beautiful

I'm holding every breath for you
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up is
My God, he's beautiful
So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle


Yes I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Oh, and he kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him.."
"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be


I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight


'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

"Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground 
Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you wont remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history

I'll be one of the many saying

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?"
"Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones

Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

I hit the Sunday matine
You know the greatest films of all time were never made


I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one



I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now


I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone


But we were something, don't you think so?

Whispers of ""Are yousure?""

August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

"Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause ofme
Betty,one time Iwas riding on my skateboard
When Ipassed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you


But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long


Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again


The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party


Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again"
"You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse


Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left yououttherestanding
Crestfallen on thelanding
Champagne problems
Your mom'sring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating


Dom Prignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny

I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly

I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


Cherry lips, crystal skies

Stolen kisses, pretty lies

Be that girl for a month

And if I'm on fire,you'llbe made ofashes, too
Even on my worst day,did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause Ilovedyou,I swear Iloved you
'Til mydying day


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you 
And when you can't sleep at night 


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years"
"You are somebody that I don't know

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""


And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh 
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down


You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? 
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night


You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay


So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom

Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry

And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor

Never be the same now, now

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer


Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

Running scared, I was there

Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there

"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coasttookher mind offSt. Louis
Bill was the heir tothe Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""Howdidamiddle-class divorce doit?""
The wedding wascharming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dal


And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

"Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing overthecreek
I was tooscared to jump in
But I, Iwas high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on


Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, wont tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever"

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

"I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn'tknowif you'd careif I came back
I have alot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


At least I'm trying


And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you

And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you



And I should just tell you to leave
'Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style


So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road 
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat 
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl


He says, ""What you heard is true
But I can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""


'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

"Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friendsyou'reout for arun
Youll be flushed when you return
Takethe road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you dont even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times


And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""

But now I'm rightdownin it, allthe years I've given
Is just shitwe're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet


There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness


Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury

I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too


Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness


In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind"
"I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I


I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistn
You're so much older and wiser and I


I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it


While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I


Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it"
"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end uponthefloor, anyway?"" yousay
""Your roommate's cheap-assscrew-top ros, that's how""
I see you every day now


And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew btween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up


And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was 
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was 
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon


And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy 
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

"Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire


And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind th tape, but all it does is pause
On th very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed


And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore


Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother

I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you

For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind

Echoes  of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession

I would  fall from grace
Just to  touch your face

I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door


At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nver seen a love as pure as it
And thn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea

I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you


And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah


This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched ""aurora borealis green""
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

"No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

In shades of gray in candlelight

Do you wish you could still touch her?

And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the grey
I just may like to have a conversation


Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
You might also like
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight

"You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around


And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that


Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around

Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

"If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison,youcould've
Spit me outat the first chance
And if Iwas some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?


Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering


If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us


Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe


I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil

I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time


If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first


And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen

"We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...


I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you 


And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English


You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates

"We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rentaplace on CorneliaStreet""
I say casually in the car
Wewere a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone


But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

"If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me


So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parkd my car right between the Methodist
And th school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me


We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown


Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend

"My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night

And now I see daylight, I only see daylight 
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


And I can still see it all 
All of you, all of me 
I once believed love would be 
But it's golden 
And I can still see it all 
Back and forth from New York 
I once believed love would be 
But it's golden

Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of

"Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain


He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

Take me to the Lakeswhere all the poets went to die
I don't belong and,mybeloved,neither do you
ThoseWindermere peaks looklike a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse


I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry"
"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life 


No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the storys over, why am I still writing pages?


Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough

And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room

With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but


Dont read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and youre turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home


Don't read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong or we're making mistakes

"Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?


And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down


The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?


'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring


Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

"And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game""


Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me


Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me


Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it

Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

"The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe



Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night 
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright 
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life

In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

"No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears

You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Did some bird flap its wings ovr in Asia?
Did some force take you bcause I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind


But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show


But you showed who you are, then one magical night


I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed

"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time


And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind


You see, all the wisst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game


If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails


What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design

I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care


So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine"

Diamonds in my eyes

Nice


Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl 
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons

Ooh, but you won't like it that way

Lost in the labyrinth of my mind

Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

Lipstick on your face
So it goes

And I'm yours to lose

Do bad things with you
So it goes

All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone


'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

So it goes


Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now

"It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year


So, why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey 
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things


It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence


But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately 
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling 
Because you break them, I had to take them away

And here's to you

"I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I


Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing


I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

"Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break


And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah


Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready


'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go


And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived

Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?


How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?


And someone else lights up the room 
People love an ingnue 


I've had  too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?
And I wake up  in the middle of the night

But nothing at twenty-two?

I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt

Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

"The drought was the very worst 
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth 
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



There was nothing left to do 
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof 
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

Right where you left me

She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me


At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right

"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple

Looking at it now
Last December 
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together 
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

"My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the ltter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If w survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War


Uh-huh, uh-huh


It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair

My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember

Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning


But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We  are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me 
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance

Like you were in this room"
"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else 
Please don't have somebody waiting on you 


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless 
Don't you let it go

Dancing around all alone

Wondering if you knew

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?


Storm coming, good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money
I'd pay if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time


You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
""Wanna hang out?"" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

It's nice to have a friend

Sun sinks down, no curfew

And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh


Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me


You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills


But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

"I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world


Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you


Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""

And long, long live that look on your face"
"Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart 

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you

Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart


So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do

"When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go


Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing


Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled

Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass

"Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known


Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known


You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town

We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom

And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same


This is a state of grace

"One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up""
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love
You are in love


Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words


'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love
You are in love

"Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me


I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then


And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me




I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you


'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

All my days, I'll know your face"
"I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on


Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


Next chapter


How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me


Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how

The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight


So many things that you wish I knew

You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship I'm in
And what's in my system


I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout

The system's breaking down



I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch


A brief interruption, a slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance, let's dance


Glitch, oh, yeah

"He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity


I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 AM, pacing
He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in""
My voice comes out begging

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go


He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead


I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming


All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better

If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known

Comes back to me, burning red
 Yeah, yeah

"I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when  music's gone
Gone


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh


Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light"
"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away


I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions


And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips"

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time


Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down

In the dead of night, your eyes so green 
And I know for you, it's always me

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

 Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
 Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was 


All you had to do was 
All you had to do was

Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever

"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
You might also like
Oh, oh


And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts


I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about


Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh-oh


And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""


You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""


Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter 
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine 


Yes, yes, do you believe it? 
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now "
"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home


This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

"Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before

"I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied


But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified


'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' her, hopin' it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replayin' your laughter, disaster

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity



She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa

"It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good

See your face, hear my voice in the dark

"One, two, three, four


Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
""I'll wait for you""
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run


So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you


And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
You might also like
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
"Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane?""
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say


I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl 
And that's how it works

Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh

And never told her why, why

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



But loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

"It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaminginsideand frozen intime
You did all that you coulddo
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think theyre right
You were outnumbered this time


But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget


They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun


Only one thing can save us
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young
Only the young 
Only the young

And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man


Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know


Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

But all you are is mean


All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean


But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


Now, its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that youre lucky, but youre so confused
'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if youll make it out alive


And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress

And asking me about you

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress

But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better


And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye 


You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide

"Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back


A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful


What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair"

And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

Your very first day"
"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back


Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then


Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?


It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh

"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way


I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying

The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless


So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless


Well, you stood there with me in the doorway

You pull me in and I'm a little more brave

"I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts


But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be


I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love

I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight


'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

"You said, ""I know""
When I said, ""I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this""
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back


And I said, ""When can I-I-I come back?""

And you said, ""That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when""
Mm, mm


I said, ""I know""
When you said, ""I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this"" 
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, ""Leave those all in our past""

"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say


Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours"
"You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake


Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead


Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing


Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong

I'm sure she'll make you happy

Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah


Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

4 a.m. the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in

"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again


I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

"I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""

"We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand

Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone


But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep

This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby

On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash

Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby


And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing

"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
You might also like
Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
You didn't mean it, baby, I don't think so

"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Won't let no one break your heart

Please try to never grow up


Oh, oh"
"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""


Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now

Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow

Ooh, la

I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha


So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""
And you say, ""Let's run away now 
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows "
"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to


It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

I'm sorry, I'm sorry 
I'm sorry,  I'm sorry"
"I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you





I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town lik an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry  at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious 
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations


Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'?
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl


I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away


Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different 
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different 
It hits different 'cause it's you

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by

Catastrophic blues

"I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah


Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same


'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel

Can't help it if there's no one else

"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong


You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me


You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

"Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now


If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door

You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now""

And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that


I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned


So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that


I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you



Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through"
"All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around


You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before


But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway


But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together

I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together

It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh-oh-oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

"She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my


A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee


Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
You might also like
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine"
"In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread


So, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah


I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door

What I mean is


I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
You might also like
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all"
"And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So, we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight aint fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away


Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today


Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh

"I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you comin'
And I'll never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never  
Saw you comin' 
 
And I'll never  
Be the same 




This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

"There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, farless


So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this on-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh


Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""
And I feel perfectly fine


But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing

"Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side


And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you


Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

You say that you can't live without me

"I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe


You lift my feet off the ground

That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night

Tell me why

'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me


Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you"
"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But ther was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knw


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
You might also like
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?


You should've been here
And I would've been so happy


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around


This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh"
"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
W block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for th first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room

"I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

"Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wdnesday in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you nver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do


But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again




And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up

That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

"Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause w had a beautiful, magic love ther
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Whoa, oh, whoa, oh


Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us, we can't get back


A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

Im not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine

And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye


You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared

Chose the rose garden over Madison Square

And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby

Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

Take away the pain

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down

We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you


Ooh, oh
Yeah, hey, yeah


I don't know about you 
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if 
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me 
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancin' like we're 
Twenty-two 
Twenty-two 
Twenty-two 
Twenty-two 


It feels like one of those nights 
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights 
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights 
You look like bad news"
"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them

I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

Your very first day"
"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talkaboutit
'CauseI read youshould never leavea fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
You might also like
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
"I remember when we broke up
The first time, saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change""
""Trust me,"" remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, evr, ever getting back togther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm


The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to


It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend

"Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone


In losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time


This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh

"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time

Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistak, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have th upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry


'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well

Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

"Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?


Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but


Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

"I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing whn we walked in
The night w snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall

Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history

Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raidd, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when th fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this


Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There aint nothing more right, babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning lonelinss
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
Whn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar


You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start


Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shads of wrong
We learn to live with th pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""

"I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love, he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie


He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine


I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie


He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is, ""My God, hes beautiful""

And pray for a miracle

I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse


I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
Not without you
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die

I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around


Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale


Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

"I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone


All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off

"So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session.Iwas writing withtwo writers I hadn't ever workedwith before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called ""I Forgot That You Existed"", and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started


I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice


I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
I forgot that you existed
How I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?


I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't

Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!


Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me

How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
You might also like
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"

To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?

The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history"
"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?"
"Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you knownothing
Sequinsmile, black lipstick
Sensualpolitics
When you are young, they assumeyou know nothing


But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
You might also like
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan"
"I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's notfunnyat all
And ittook you five whole minutes
To packus up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall


I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Ooh, ooh, ooh


I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury


I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign

I never learned to read your mind

"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my lover


Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home

"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought Isawyou at thebus stop, I didn't though
I hitthe ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matine
You know the greatest films of all time were never made


I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one



I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now


I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone


But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone

"Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are yousure?""
""Neverhave I everbefore""


But I can see us lostin the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you


But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine


Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

"I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage

Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie

Isn't cool, no, I don't like you

Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast

"Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause ofme
Betty,one time Iwas riding on my skateboard
When Ipassed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says

I dreamt of you all summer long


Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again


The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party


Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again"
"You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse


Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left yououttherestanding
Crestfallen on thelanding
Champagne problems
Your mom'sring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating


Dom Prignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you 
And when you can't sleep at night 


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years"

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? 
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night


You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay


So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud

"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face

Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it 


Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying 
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying 


So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I usedtothink I wouldmeet somebody there
Teal was the colorof your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
Youusedtowork at tomake a littlemoney


Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer


Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies

"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there

So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there

"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coasttookher mind offSt. Louis
Bill was the heir tothe Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""Howdidamiddle-class divorce doit?""
The wedding wascharming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dal


And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing overthecreek
I was tooscared to jump in
But I, Iwas high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on


Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, wont tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater

Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that

Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh

And I should just tell you to leave

But I watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friendsyou'reout for arun
Youll be flushed when you return
Takethe road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you dont even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times


And you wanna scream

When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?

Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I


Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it

Tell me I've got it wrong somehow

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh


I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end uponthefloor, anyway?"" yousay
""Your roommate's cheap-assscrew-top ros, that's how""
I see you every day now


And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew btween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up


And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was 
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was 
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon


And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy 
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

"Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire


And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind th tape, but all it does is pause
On th very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed


And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore


Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Shining just for you


And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another

Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you


I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed

Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much 

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine


You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face 
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous


You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you

I've ghosted stand there in the room

I end up in crisis

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming


It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

I searched ""aurora borealis green""

And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah


Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
Im spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about

My hands are shaking from holding back from you

Flashback when you met me, your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes, my rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

My barren land

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark

I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared


You're on your own, kid
You always have been


I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid


You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this"

Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
""Doc, I think she's crashing out""

Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?


Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years


I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you


I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question


Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the grey

And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering


If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us

You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English


You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon

Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rentaplace on CorneliaStreet""
I say casually in the car
Wewere a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone


But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend

While I was gone, I would've asked you

There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me


So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parkd my car right between the Methodist
And th school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me


We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house

We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown


Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving

Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain


He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted

"Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all thesecynicalclones

Take me to the Lakeswhere all the poets went to die
I don't belong and,mybeloved,neither do you
ThoseWindermere peaks looklike a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse


I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry"
"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life 


No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared 


No cameras catch my muffled cries

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the storys over, why am I still writing pages?


Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough

'Cause I cant pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts


My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room

With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars

"Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?


And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down


The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?


'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you



Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet"
"How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived intheshade you werethrowing
'Til all of my sunshine wasgone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind


But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show


But you showed who you are, then one magical night


I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did

"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time


And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind


You see, all the wisst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game


If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails


What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care


So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine"
"I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyones up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh

Outside, they're push and shovin

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that Im just too soft for all of it
Ooh

"Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight


Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put m in the basement
Whn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

Nice


Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl 
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world, have you heard? 
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you 
But I miss sparklin' 


Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

"I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something youdidntdo
I pinned yourhands behind your back, oh

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til theres no us

I dont wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you 
I need to say, hey, its all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow


It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh


I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like Im not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
Wed still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and were begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you

"Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya


Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea 
Dorothea 


Ooh, you'r a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything


Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well


Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show


But it's never too late to come back to my side

Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be gettin' over you my whole life


You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?


It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile


You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that


Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love

"See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone


'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes


Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

"It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year


So, why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey 
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things


It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence


But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately 
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling

"I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I


Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing


I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

"Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break


And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready


'Cause I fell from the pedestal

Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing

Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go


And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff

Once I've lost my novelty?

But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?


How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?


And someone else lights up the room 
People love an ingnue

If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around


What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
You might also like
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me


What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive


And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around"
"The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...


Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...


Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to


And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?


This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

"The drought was the very worst 
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth 
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



There was nothing left to do 
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof 
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



I think I am finally clean

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean

"It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right

"Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me


Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

Right where you left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever


Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me


At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on


Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered 
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good


Looking at it now
Last December 
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together 
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?

But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me

"My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the ltter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If w survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War


Uh-huh, uh-huh


It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back


To that bloodshed, crimson clover

My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, we're burned for better
I vowed I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War


Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War"
"I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic


I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man


I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning


But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run


Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah


Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

A better man

We might still be in love, if you were a better man

"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We  are never, ever, ever getting back together

"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room

"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go

Please don't have somebody waiting on you

Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?

Bad omen

Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me


You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills


But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

"I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world


Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine

I had the time of my life with you


Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face"
"Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart 

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you

Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart


So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do


But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a caf, I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

"When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go


Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing


Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled

Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

"Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known


Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known


You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town

"We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom


'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace 
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

Some wannabe Z-lister

2003, unbearable

No, I didn't, but thanks, though


I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else


Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sip quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

"Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone


Been losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time


This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same


This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

"One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up""
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love
You are in love


Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you

"Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me


I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then


And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me




I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you

Taking flight, making me feel right

'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on


Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

"I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when  music's gone
Gone


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh


Just close your eyes

"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away


I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips"

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I 


You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time


Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof 
And you know for me, it's always you 
In the dead of night, your eyes so green 
And I know for you, it's always me

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

 Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
 Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was 


All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was stay


Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye


 Hey, all you had to do was stay

"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
You might also like
Oh, oh


And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts


I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about


Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh-oh


And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""


You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""


Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter 
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine 


Yes, yes, do you believe it? 
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now "
"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home


This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

"Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat

The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me"
"I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied


But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified


'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' her, hopin' it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replayin' your laughter, disaster


'Cause now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity



She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

"It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

See your face, hear my voice in the dark

"One, two, three, four


Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
""I'll wait for you""
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run


So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you


And run, like you'd run from the law

Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run

"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright

She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane?""

And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say


I want you for worse or for better

Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



But loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

Comes back to me, burning red

"It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaminginsideand frozen intime
You did all that you coulddo
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think theyre right
You were outnumbered this time


But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget


They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun


Only one thing can save us
Only the young 
Only the young

And swords and weapons that you use against me

Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man


Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

But all you are is mean


All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean


But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


Now, its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that youre lucky, but youre so confused
'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if youll make it out alive


And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights

Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one"
"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing 
And that was the moment I knew

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress

""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better


And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye 


You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better


And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

"Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back


A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful


What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair"
"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e

Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing

"I bet this time of night, youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont, I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out, theres no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye

But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

To a boy who changed his mind

"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back


Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then


Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?


It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat

In this moment now, capture it, remember it

I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?

"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say


Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine

Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead


Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

"Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy


But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah


Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this


But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?


So I'll walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say we're still friends

So if I see you again


Don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you  say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't  know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

"You said it in a simple way
4 a.m. the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way

"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again


I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

"I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

"We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy


Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy

We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark

"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry


'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone


But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe


When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

"It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby
Bye bye, baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little

Won't let no one break your heart

Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""


Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?


Don't say yes, run away now

But I'm only lookin' at you

But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha


So, don't say yes, run away now

"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to


It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend

You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you





I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town lik an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry  at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious 
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Cursed the space that I needed

You were the one that I loved

A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl


I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away


Oh, my, love is a lie

"I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

For staying back and watching me shine"
"Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah


Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same


'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong


You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me


You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes


You should've said no, you should've gone home

"Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now


If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door


And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now""

"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that


I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned


So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that


I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have


And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you



Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through"
"All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around


You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before


But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 
You're not sorry 


You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade


So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry

"Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you


Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway


But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

"She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my


A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee


Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
You might also like
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine"
"In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread


So, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah


I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more

What I mean is


I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
You might also like
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all"
"And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So, we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight aint fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away


Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today


Ahh-ahh-ahh

"I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you comin'
And I'll never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never  
Saw you comin' 
 
And I'll never  
Be the same 




This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

"There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, farless


So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this on-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh


Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless

And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing

Everything I need is right here by my side


And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you


Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do


And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me


I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you

"I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh


Baby, you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh-oh


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes"
"I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are


I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh


I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why


Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?


I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in

Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night

Tell me why

He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work

He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, ""How are you?
I say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay

I loved you from the very first day

Wishing the card was from you

"Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, ""Does he know?""
Will you ever know?


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, ""Hey, by the way""


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful


If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?

But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the on who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You blong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

"I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go


I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late, so you see


You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

"I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together


Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall


Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and  jump then fall into me

And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But ther was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knw


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress

And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here

I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here

And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
W block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for th first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance

Tonight I'm gonna dance

"I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wdnesday in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you nver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do


But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid

What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

It takes everything in me not to call you

But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore


Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain


I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start


Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear


I'll leave my window open

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the thingsIwantedto
Of all thegirls tossing rocksat your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you 
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same


'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now

All I know is a simpl name
Everything has changed
All I know is you hld the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies

Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread


Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah


I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles

Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
"The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

And make fun of our exes

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh


Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talkaboutit
'CauseI read youshould never leavea fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

"I remember when we broke up
The first time, saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change""
""Trust me,"" remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, evr, ever getting back togther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm


The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again

I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistak, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have th upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?

Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but


Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?


It's not unbroken anymore 
How do I get it back the way it was before?

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

"I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing whn we walked in
The night w snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lft me waiting in the cold
And you've got your shar of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh

Keep your ey-eyes open


The tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open


Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

Every lesson forms a new scar

But you got something they don't
Yeah, you got something they don't

I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

"Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground 
Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""

Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raidd, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when th fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this


Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There aint nothing more right, babe

Help but wish I could see your face

I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning lonelinss
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
Whn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town

I'd be counting down the ways to see you

But I don't wanna have to go that far

Talk to the man who put you here

Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shads of wrong
We learn to live with th pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

And I count the colors in his eyes

As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie


He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine


I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

First thought when I wake up
Is, ""My God, hes beautiful""

Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time


And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is dont let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same


This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
You might also like
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same


This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight"
"I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss


All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone


All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better


You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way


All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble"
"So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session.Iwas writing withtwo writers I hadn't ever workedwith before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called ""I Forgot That You Existed"", and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started


I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice


I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
I forgot that you existed
How I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?


I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice"
"But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
But girls could say he's just a bit too tall

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

In the least or masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

"I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!


Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!


Oh, you are everything I'll never need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is


Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?"
"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
You might also like
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
"I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh


'Cause they said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'


Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
They said the end is comin' 
Everyone's up to somethin' 
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin' "
"I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love
He swears, as herunshisfingers through hishair
I'm laughing 'causeI hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the Seventeenth
His sister's bautiful
He has his father's eys
And if you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie


He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine


I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the Seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him..

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up is
My God, he's beautiful
So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle


Yes I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Oh, and he kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him.."
"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be


I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight


'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

"Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground 
Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you wont remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance

"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?"
"Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you knownothing
Sequinsmile, black lipstick
Sensualpolitics
When you are young, they assumeyou know nothing


But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

So I'm leaving out the side door

"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my lover


Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""

I hitthe ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matine
You know the greatest films of all time were never made


I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one



I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now


I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone


But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool

"Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are yousure?""
""Neverhave I everbefore""


But I can see us lostin the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you


But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine


Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

"Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause ofme
Betty,one time Iwas riding on my skateboard
When Ipassed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long


Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again


The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party


Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again"
"You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse


Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left yououttherestanding
Crestfallen on thelanding
Champagne problems
Your mom'sring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating


Dom Prignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly

I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


Cherry lips, crystal skies

Stolen kisses, pretty lies

Be that girl for a month

And if I'm on fire,you'llbe made ofashes, too
Even on my worst day,did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause Ilovedyou,I swear Iloved you
'Til mydying day


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you 
And when you can't sleep at night 


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years"
"You are somebody that I don't know

But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""


And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

You need to calm down


You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? 
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night


You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay


So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever

Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry

And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor

Never be the same now, now

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer


Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece

Running scared, I was there

Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there

"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coasttookher mind offSt. Louis
Bill was the heir tothe Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""Howdidamiddle-class divorce doit?""
The wedding wascharming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dal


And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

"Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing overthecreek
I was tooscared to jump in
But I, Iwas high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on


Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, wont tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever"

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

"I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn'tknowif you'd careif I came back
I have alot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


At least I'm trying


And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you

And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

Loves me like I'm brand new

Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you



And I should just tell you to leave
'Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style


So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road 
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat 
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl


He says, ""What you heard is true
But I can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""


'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

"Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friendsyou'reout for arun
Youll be flushed when you return
Takethe road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you dont even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times


And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""

You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

But now I'm rightdownin it, allthe years I've given
Is just shitwe're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet


There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness


Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury

I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too


Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness


In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind"
"I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I


I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistn
You're so much older and wiser and I


I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it


While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I


Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it"
"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh


I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around

When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end uponthefloor, anyway?"" yousay
""Your roommate's cheap-assscrew-top ros, that's how""
I see you every day now


And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew btween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up


And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was 
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was 
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon


And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy 
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

"Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire


And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind th tape, but all it does is pause
On th very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed


And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore


Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother

At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning



It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me 
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it
And then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from hell""

I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me

"Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life


I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you

For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, ""She's gone too far this time""

And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby 
Echoes  of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy


And, baby, for you
I would  fall from grace
Just to  touch your face

"Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in


But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door


At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nver seen a love as pure as it
And thn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

"One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you


And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah


This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched ""aurora borealis green""
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true


Now it's like snow at the beach

"No, nothing good starts in a getaway car


It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it and you didnt see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason

""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me

The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin and I was just drinkin

Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question


Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the grey
I just may like to have a conversation


Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
You might also like
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight

"You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around


And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that


Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around

Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me


'Cause karma is my boyfriend

"If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison,youcould've
Spit me outat the first chance
And if Iwas some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?


Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering


If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us


Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe


I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil

I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time


If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first


And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen

"We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...


I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you 


And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English


You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true

"We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rentaplace on CorneliaStreet""
I say casually in the car
Wewere a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone


But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

"If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me


So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parkd my car right between the Methodist
And th school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me


We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown


Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend

"My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night

And now I see daylight, I only see daylight 
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


And I can still see it all 
All of you, all of me 
I once believed love would be 
But it's golden 
And I can still see it all 
Back and forth from New York 
I once believed love would be 
But it's golden

Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of

"Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain


He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

Take me to the Lakeswhere all the poets went to die
I don't belong and,mybeloved,neither do you
ThoseWindermere peaks looklike a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse


I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry"
"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life 


No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the storys over, why am I still writing pages?

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust

Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough

Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough


And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh-woah

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh-woah
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh-woah


And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah 
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting"

Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but


Dont read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and youre turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home


Don't read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

"Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?


And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down


The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?


'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring


Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

"And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game""


Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me


Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me


Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it

Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

"The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe



Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night 
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright 
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life

In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

"No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears

You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Did some bird flap its wings ovr in Asia?
Did some force take you bcause I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind


But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show


But you showed who you are, then one magical night


I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed

"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time


And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind


You see, all the wisst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game


If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails


What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design

'Cause I care


So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine"

Diamonds in my eyes

Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl 
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons

Ooh, but you won't like it that way

Lost in the labyrinth of my mind

But when you get me alone, it's so simple

Lipstick on your face
So it goes

And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes


Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone


'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

So it goes


Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now

"It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year


So, why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey 
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things


It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence


But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately 
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling 
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice  things, honey

And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

"I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I


Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing


I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

"Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break


And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah


Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready


'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go


And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived

Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?


How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?


And someone else lights up the room 
People love an ingnue 


I've had  too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?
And I wake up  in the middle of the night

But nothing at twenty-two?

I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt

Watched as you signed your name Marjorie

And how you left them all to me

"The drought was the very worst 
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth 
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



There was nothing left to do 
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof 
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me


At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right

"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple

Looking at it now
Last December 
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together 
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

"My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the ltter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If w survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War


Uh-huh, uh-huh


It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair

My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, we're burned for better

I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man


I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning


But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

If you were a better man"
"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We  are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me 
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance

Like you were in this room"
"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else 
Please don't have somebody waiting on you 


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home

Dancing around all alone

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?


Storm coming, good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money
I'd pay if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

The slowest way is never loving them enough

Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one

Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

It's nice to have a friend

Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine

And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh


Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me


You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills


But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

"I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world


Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you


Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""

And long, long live that look on your face"
"Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart 

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you

Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart


So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song

I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do

"When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go


Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing

Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled

Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass

"Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known


Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known


You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now

We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom

And every day is like a battle

"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same


This is a state of grace

Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up""
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love
You are in love


Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love
You might also like
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words


'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love
You are in love 
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you 
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you 
You can see it with the lights out, lights out "
"Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me


I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then


And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me




I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you


'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

"I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on


Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


Next chapter


How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me


Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how

Of who can act like they care less

The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight


So many things that you wish I knew

You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship I'm in
And what's in my system


I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout

The system's breaking down



I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch


A brief interruption, a slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance, let's dance


Glitch, oh, yeah

"He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity


I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 AM, pacing
He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in""
My voice comes out begging

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go


He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead


I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming


All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better

If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known

Comes back to me, burning red
 Yeah, yeah

"I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when  music's gone
Gone


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh


Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light"
"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away


I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions


And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips"

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time


Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down

In the dead of night, your eyes so green 
And I know for you, it's always me

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

 Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
 Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was 


All you had to do was 
All you had to do was

Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
You might also like
Oh, oh


And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts


I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about


Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh-oh


And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""


You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""


Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter 
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine 


Yes, yes, do you believe it? 
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now "
"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

"Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me"
"I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied


But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified


'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' her, hopin' it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replayin' your laughter, disaster


'Cause now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause


'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go

But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity



She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

"It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good

See your face, hear my voice in the dark

"One, two, three, four


Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
""I'll wait for you""
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run


So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you


And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run

"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
"Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane?""
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say


I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl 
And that's how it works

Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh

And never told her why, why

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



But loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

"It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaminginsideand frozen intime
You did all that you coulddo
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think theyre right
You were outnumbered this time


But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget


They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun


Only one thing can save us
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young

And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man


Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know


Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

But all you are is mean


All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean


But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


Now, its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that youre lucky, but youre so confused
'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if youll make it out alive


And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress

And asking me about you

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress

But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better


And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye 


You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide

"Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back


A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

Your very first day"
"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back


Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then


Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?


It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way


I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be


'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health


'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying

"There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless


So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless


Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless

"I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts


But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

""Do you know how much I miss you?""


I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
""I miss you like it was the very first night""

"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be


I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love

I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight


'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

"You said, ""I know""
When I said, ""I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this""
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back


And I said, ""When can I-I-I come back?""

And you said, ""That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when""
Mm, mm


I said, ""I know""
When you said, ""I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this"" 
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, ""Leave those all in our past""


And you said, ""When can I-I-I come back?""

"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say


Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours"
"You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake


Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead


Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing


Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong

"Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy


But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah


Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this


But don't you, don't you

Missed me if you don't want me again

4 a.m. the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in

"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again


I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

"I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing

"We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand

Happy endings, now I know

Put those Georgia stars to shame that night

Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone


But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep

Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby
Bye bye, baby

On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby


And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
You might also like
Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
You didn't mean it, baby, I don't think so

"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up

Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up


Oh, oh"
"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""


Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now 
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow

And they said, ""Speak now""

Ooh, la
Ooh, ooh


I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha


So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""
And you say, ""Let's run away now 
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows "
"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to


It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

I'm sorry, I'm sorry 
I'm sorry,  I'm sorry"
"I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you





I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town lik an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry  at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious 
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations


Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'?
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl


I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away


Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different 
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different 
It hits different 'cause it's you

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
'Cause it's you
Catastrophic blues

"I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah


Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same


'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Can't help it if there's no one else

"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong


You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me


You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness

"Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now


If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door

You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now""

"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that


I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned


So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that


I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have


And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you



Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through"
"All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around


You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before


But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

"Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you


Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway


But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven


I'm caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh-oh-oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

"She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my


A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee


Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
You might also like
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine"
"In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread


So, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah


I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on

What I mean is


I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
You might also like
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all"
"And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So, we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight aint fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away


Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today


Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

"I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you comin'
And I'll never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never  
Saw you comin' 
 
And I'll never  
Be the same 




This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

"There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, farless


So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this on-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh


Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

And I feel perfectly fine


But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing

"Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side


And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you


Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

"I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me


Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you"
"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But ther was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knw


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
You might also like
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?


You should've been here
And I would've been so happy


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around


This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh"
"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
W block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for th first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room

"I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

"Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wdnesday in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you nver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do


But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again




And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up

That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

"Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause w had a beautiful, magic love ther
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Whoa, oh, whoa, oh


Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us, we can't get back


A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

Im not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here

In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine

And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye


You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared

Chose the rose garden over Madison Square

And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby

Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

Take away the pain

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down

Twenty-two 
Twenty-two
Twenty-two 


It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you


Ooh, oh
Yeah, hey, yeah


I don't know about you 
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if 
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me 
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancin' like we're 
Twenty-two

"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

Your very first day"
"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talkaboutit
'CauseI read youshould never leavea fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
You might also like
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
"I remember when we broke up
The first time, saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change""
""Trust me,"" remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, evr, ever getting back togther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm


The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to


It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend

"Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone


In losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time


This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh

"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to

Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistak, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have th upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry


'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well

"Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?


Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but


Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

"I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing whn we walked in
The night w snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

For staying back and watching me shine"
"Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground 
Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

And they put your picture in a frame
You know that Ill be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

"Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raidd, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when th fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this


Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There aint nothing more right, babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning lonelinss
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
Whn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar


You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore


Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain


I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start


Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear


I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shads of wrong
We learn to live with th pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same


This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

"I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love, he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie


He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine


I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie


He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is, ""My God, hes beautiful""
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle

I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse


I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
Not without you
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry"
"Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale


Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around


Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale


Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

"I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss


All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone


All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off

We don't have to do things their way

"So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session.Iwas writing withtwo writers I hadn't ever workedwith before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called ""I Forgot That You Existed"", and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started


I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice


I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
I forgot that you existed
How I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?


I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice"

As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!


Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!


Oh, you are everything I'll never need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby

Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?"
"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
You might also like
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"

Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket

I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'

And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be


I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love

I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history"
"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?"
"Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you knownothing
Sequinsmile, black lipstick
Sensualpolitics
When you are young, they assumeyou know nothing


But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
You might also like
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan"
"I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's notfunnyat all
And ittook you five whole minutes
To packus up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall


I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Ooh, ooh, ooh


I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury


I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign

I never learned to read your mind 
I couldn't turn things around

"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my lover


Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home

"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought Isawyou at thebus stop, I didn't though
I hitthe ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matine
You know the greatest films of all time were never made


I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one



I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now


I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone


But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone

"Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are yousure?""
""Neverhave I everbefore""


But I can see us lostin the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you


But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine


Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

"I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage

Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie

Isn't cool, no, I don't like you 


But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast

And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure

"Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause ofme
Betty,one time Iwas riding on my skateboard
When Ipassed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says

A figment of my worst intentions

Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long


Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again


The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party


Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again"
"You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse


Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left yououttherestanding
Crestfallen on thelanding
Champagne problems
Your mom'sring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating


Dom Prignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you 
And when you can't sleep at night 


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years"

And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""


And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

You need to calm down


You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? 
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night


You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay


So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud

"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face

"Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

Are you ready for it?


Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it 
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it 


Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying 
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying 


So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

"Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I usedtothink I wouldmeet somebody there
Teal was the colorof your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
Youusedtowork at tomake a littlemoney


Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer


Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me

All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all"
"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coasttookher mind offSt. Louis
Bill was the heir tothe Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""Howdidamiddle-class divorce doit?""
The wedding wascharming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dal


And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

"Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing overthecreek
I was tooscared to jump in
But I, Iwas high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on


Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I


Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, wont tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever"

Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


At least I'm trying

You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh

And I should just tell you to leave

But I watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

Takethe road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you dont even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times


And you wanna scream

Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?

Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I


Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it

Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it"
"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh


I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end uponthefloor, anyway?"" yousay
""Your roommate's cheap-assscrew-top ros, that's how""
I see you every day now


And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew btween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up


And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was 
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was 
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon


And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy 
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

"Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire


And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind th tape, but all it does is pause
On th very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed


And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore


Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Shining just for you


And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Taking mine, but it's been promised to another

Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you


I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed

He wants what's only yours

All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much 

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine


You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face 
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?

That I'm talking to everyone here but you

I've ghosted stand there in the room

I end up in crisis

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming


It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

I searched ""aurora borealis green""

And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah


Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
Im spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about

Flashback when you met me, your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes, my rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Don't want no other shade of blue but you

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark

"Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared


You're on your own, kid
You always have been


I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid


You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this"

Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
""Doc, I think she's crashing out""

Only twenty minutes to sleep

Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?


Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years


I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you


I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride

But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question


Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the grey

Would've, could've, should've

And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering


If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true

And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English


You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon

Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rentaplace on CorneliaStreet""
I say casually in the car
Wewere a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone


But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend

While I was gone, I would've asked you

There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me


So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parkd my car right between the Methodist
And th school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me


We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house

Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown


Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving

Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight


It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain


He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted

"Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?

Take me to the Lakeswhere all the poets went to die
I don't belong and,mybeloved,neither do you
ThoseWindermere peaks looklike a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse


I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry"
"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life 


No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared 


No cameras catch my muffled cries

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the storys over, why am I still writing pages?


Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough

'Cause I cant pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts


My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room

With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

"Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?


And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down


The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?


'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you


What could've been, would've been you
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you



Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet"
"How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived intheshade you werethrowing
'Til all of my sunshine wasgone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind


But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show


But you showed who you are, then one magical night


I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference

I forgot that you existed

"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time


And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind


You see, all the wisst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game


If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails


What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care


So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine"
"I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyones up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, theyre push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that Im just too soft for all of it
Ooh

"Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight


Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put m in the basement
Whn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

Nice


Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl 
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world, have you heard? 
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you 
But I miss sparklin' 


Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

"I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something youdidntdo
I pinned yourhands behind your back, oh

Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til theres no us

I dont wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you 
I need to say, hey, its all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow


It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh


I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like Im not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it

We'd still worship this love
Wed still worship this love

I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and were begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you

"Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya


Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea 
Dorothea 


Ooh, you'r a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything


Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well


Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show


But it's never too late to come back to my side

Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out

You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?


It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile


You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that


Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love

"See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone


'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes


Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

"It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year


So, why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey 
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things


It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence


But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately 
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling

"I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I


Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing


I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break


And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing

Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

Right down the rabbit hole

Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff

But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?


How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?

You're alive, so alive


Never be so polit
You forget your power
Nevr wield such power
You forget to be polite


And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead

You're alive, so alive

The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me


What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive


And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around"
"The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...


Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...


Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to


And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?


This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

"The drought was the very worst 
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth 
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



There was nothing left to do 
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof 
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



I think I am finally clean

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean

"It's been a long time

Still spells out pain

"Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me


Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

Right where you left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever


Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me


At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on


Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered 
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good


Looking at it now
Last December 
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together 
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me

"My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the ltter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If w survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it


All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War


Uh-huh, uh-huh


It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back


To that bloodshed, crimson clover

My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, we're burned for better
I vowed I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War


Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War"
"I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic


I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man


I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning


But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run


Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

A better man

We might still be in love, if you were a better man

"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We  are never, ever, ever getting back together

"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room

"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

Please don't have somebody waiting on you

Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?

Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me


You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills


But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

"I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world


Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you


Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face"
"Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart 

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you

Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss


Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart


So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do


But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a caf, I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

"When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse


That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go


Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing


Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled

Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

"Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known


Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known


You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town

"We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom


'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace 
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003, unbearable

No, I didn't, but thanks, though


I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else


Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sip quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

"Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone


Been losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time


This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never 
Saw you coming
And Ill never 
Be the same


This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

"One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up""
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out 
You are in love, true love
You are in love


Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love


You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you

"Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me


I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then


And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me




I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you

Taking flight, making me feel right

'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on


Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking

See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

"I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when  music's gone
Gone


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh


Just close your eyes

"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away


I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips"

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I 


You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time


Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof 
And you know for me, it's always you 
In the dead of night, your eyes so green 
And I know for you, it's always me 
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I"

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

 Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
 Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was 


All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was stay


Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
You might also like
Oh, oh


And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""


Oh, oh, oh"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts


I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about


Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh-oh


And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""


You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""


Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter 
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine 


Yes, yes, do you believe it? 
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now "
"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home


This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

"Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you

The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me"
"I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied


But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified


'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' her, hopin' it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replayin' your laughter, disaster


'Cause now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity



She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

"It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

"One, two, three, four


Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
""I'll wait for you""
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run


So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you


And run, like you'd run from the law

We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run

"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile

The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright

She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane?""

And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



But loving him was red




Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



Oh, red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

Comes back to me, burning red

"It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaminginsideand frozen intime
You did all that you coulddo
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think theyre right
You were outnumbered this time


But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget


They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun


Only one thing can save us
Only the young 
Only the young

And swords and weapons that you use against me

Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man


Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

But all you are is mean


All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean


But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


Now, its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that youre lucky, but youre so confused
'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if youll make it out alive


And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights

Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one"
"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing 
And that was the moment I knew

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress

""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better


And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye 


You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better


And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

"Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back


A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful


What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair"
"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me

Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning

"I bet this time of night, youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont, I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out, theres no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye

But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back


Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then


Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?


It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here

I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you


I wish I could fly

I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

I fake a smile so he won't see

Everything that we should be

And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?

"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say


Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine

Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead


Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing


Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out

"Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy


But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah


Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this


But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?


So I'll walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say we're still friends

So if I see you again


Don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you  say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't  know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

"You said it in a simple way
4 a.m. the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way

"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again


I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

And when I got home, 'fore I said amen

"I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

"We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy


Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy

We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark

"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry


'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone


But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe


When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

"It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye, baby
Bye bye, baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past


Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little

Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""


Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?


Don't say yes, run away now

But I'm only lookin' at you

But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha


So, don't say yes, run away now

"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to


It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend

You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you





I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town lik an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry  at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious 
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Cursed the space that I needed

You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl


I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away


Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by

"I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

For staying back and watching me shine"
"Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah


Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same


'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong


You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me


You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness

"Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose


Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now


If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door


And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now""

"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that


I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned


So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that


I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have


And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you



Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through"
"All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around


You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before


But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 
You're not sorry 


You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade


So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

"Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you


Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway


But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together

"She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my


A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee


Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
You might also like
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine"
"In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread


So, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah


I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""

What I mean is


I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
You might also like
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all"
"And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So, we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight aint fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away


Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today


Ahh-ahh-ahh

"I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


And I never 
Saw you comin'
And I'll never 
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never  
Saw you comin' 
 
And I'll never  
Be the same 




This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

"There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, farless


So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this on-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh


Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless

And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will

Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing

You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side


And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you


Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do


And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me


I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
You might also like
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell


That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you

"
"I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh


Baby, you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh-oh


You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes"
"I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are


I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh


I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why


Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?


I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why 
Tell me why

"Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, ""How are you?
I say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down


Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day


I watch superman fly away

Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be


Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day


I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground

"Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, ""Does he know?""
Will you ever know?


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, ""Hey, by the way""


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful


If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know


You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?

"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it


Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the on who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You blong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Think I know it's with me


Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?

You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe"
"I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go


I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late, so you see


You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything


How can I ever try to be better?

"I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together


Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall


Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and  jump then fall into me


'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you


Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby

"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But ther was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knw


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

In front of everyone you know?

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

'Cause it's not fair that you're not around


This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


Oh-oh, oh-oh

"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
W block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for th first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room

"I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wdnesday in a caf, I watched it begin again


You said you nver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do


But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again

That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that

Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late

Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

In your room, all alone

No reasons why

Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply

Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain


I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start


Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear


I'll leave my window open

"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the thingsIwantedto
Of all thegirls tossing rocksat your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you 
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same


'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

Know you better, know you better now

Everything has changed
All I know is you hld the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies

Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread


Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah


I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles

Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
"The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

And make fun of our exes

For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines

"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talkaboutit
'CauseI read youshould never leavea fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time

It's been occurring to me

The first time, saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say

""Trust me,"" remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, evr, ever getting back togther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm


The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout


And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will

Currents swept you out again

This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you

Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistak, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have th upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but


Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?


It's not unbroken anymore 
How do I get it back the way it was before?

"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

"I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing whn we walked in
The night w snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""


Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lft me waiting in the cold
And you've got your shar of secrets

Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""

Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raidd, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when th fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this


Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in"
"This is wrong but I can't help but feel like

I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name


So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning lonelinss
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
Whn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town

And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shads of wrong
We learn to live with th pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


I never saw you comin'

And I count the colors in his eyes

As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie


He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine


I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

First thought when I wake up
Is, ""My God, hes beautiful""

Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
"
"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time


And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is dont let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same


This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
You might also like
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same


This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight"
"I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss


All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone


All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better


You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way


All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble"
"So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session.Iwas writing withtwo writers I hadn't ever workedwith before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called ""I Forgot That You Existed"", and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started


I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice


I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
I forgot that you existed
How I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?


I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice"
"But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
But girls could say he's just a bit too tall

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

In the least or masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

"I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!


Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!



Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!


Oh, you are everything I'll never need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is


Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?"
"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
You might also like
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
"I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh


'Cause they said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'


Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh


They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
They said the end is comin' 
Everyone's up to somethin' 
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin' "
"I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love
He swears, as herunshisfingers through hishair
I'm laughing 'causeI hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the Seventeenth
His sister's bautiful
He has his father's eys
And if you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie


He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine


I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the Seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie
You might also like
He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up is
My God, he's beautiful
So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle


Yes I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Oh, and he kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him.."
"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be


I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
You might also like
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight


'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

"Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground 
Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you wont remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

I'll be one of the many saying

I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history"
