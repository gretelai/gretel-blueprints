# ðŸ“˜ Gretel SDK Blueprints

New to the Gretel SDK? This is the best place to start!

 The **Gretel SDK Blueprints** are a series of notebooks that are designed to provide a foundational introduction to the Gretel SDK. For the best experience, we recommend running these notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

---

1. [Gretel 101 Blueprint](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gretelai/gretel-blueprints/blob/main/sdk_blueprints/Gretel_101_Blueprint.ipynb) $-$ Learn the basics of the Gretel SDK by training a deep generative model in the Gretel Cloud.  

2. [Gretel Advanced Tabular Blueprint](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gretelai/gretel-blueprints/blob/main/sdk_blueprints/Gretel_Advanced_Tabular_Blueprint.ipynb) $-$ Learn how to use the Gretel SDK to customize model configurations and conditionally generate synthetic data.

3. [Gretel Text Generation Blueprint](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gretelai/gretel-blueprints/blob/main/sdk_blueprints/Gretel_Text_Generation_Blueprint.ipynb) $-$ Leverage the Gretel SDK to fine tune and prompt a multi-billion parameter large language model (LLM).
