    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Gretel Navigator SDK to build a synthetic data generation pipeline step-by-step, rather than using a single YAML configuration. We will create multi-turn user-assistant dialogues tailored for fine-tuning language models. These synthetic dialogues can then be used as domain-specific training data to improve model performance in targeted scenarios.\n",
