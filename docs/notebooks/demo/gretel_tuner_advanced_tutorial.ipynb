For each trial:\n","- Conditionally generate `num_samples` records with `target_job='entrepreneur'`.\n","- For records with `job = 'entrepreneur'`, compare the real and conditionally-generated `balance` distributions using the [KS statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) (lower is better).\n","- Calculate the custom metric score as a weighted sum of the KS complement (1 - KS -> higher is better) and Gretel's SQS score, which measures the general synthetic data quality.\n","\n","> **Note:** This example and custom metric are only meant to demonstrate functionality.
